[Arm Compiler for Linux](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Linux) is a suite of tools containing Arm C/C++ Compiler (armclang), Arm Fortran Compiler (armflang), and Arm Performance Libraries (ArmPL). It is tailored to the development of High Performance Computing (HPC) applications.

Arm Compiler for Linux runs on 64-bit Arm computers, it is not a cross-compiler.

## Prerequisites

Arm Compiler for Linux supports all 64-bit Arm based server-class hardware.
* [Supported Linux Distributions](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Linux#Supported-Devices)

Confirm you are using an Arm machine by running:

```bash { command_line="user@localhost | 2" }
uname -m
aarch64
```

If any of the following are not already installed by your Linux distribution, you must install them before installing Arm Compiler for Linux:

* Python (version 2.7 or later)
* C Libraries:
  - SUSE and RHEL
    - `glibc-devel`
  - Ubuntu
    - `libc6-dev`

## Download  {#download}

Visit [Download Arm Compiler for Linux](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-compiler-for-linux) and select the package for your Linux distribution. 
The packages contain the C/C++ and Fortran Compilers and Arm Performance Libraries.

Individual packages with only the Arm Performance Libraries (ArmPL) are also available for download.

Download releases from the command line using `wget`.

`Ubuntu`:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
wget  https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/hpc/arm-compiler-for-linux/22-1/arm-compiler-for-linux_22.1_Ubuntu-20.04_aarch64.tar
```

`Red Hat`:
```bash { target="fedora:latest" }
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/hpc/arm-compiler-for-linux/22-1/arm-compiler-for-linux_22.1_RHEL-8_aarch64.tar
```

## Installation

To install the Arm Compiler for Linux package on your 64-bit Linux Arm machine extract the package and run the installation script. 

Each command sequence includes accepting the license agreement to automate the installation and installing the `modules` software.


`Ubuntu`:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest", env="DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive" }
sudo apt-get -y install environment-modules python3 libc6-dev
tar -xvf arm-compiler-for-linux_22.1_Ubuntu-20.04_aarch64.tar 
cd arm-compiler-for-linux_22.1_Ubuntu-20.04
sudo ./arm-compiler-for-linux_22.1_Ubuntu-20.04.sh --accept
```

`Red Hat`:

```bash { target="fedora:latest" }
sudo yum -y install environment-modules python3 glibc-devel
tar -xvf arm-compiler-for-linux_22.1_RHEL-8_aarch64.tar
cd arm-compiler-for-linux_22.1_RHEL-8
sudo ./arm-compiler-for-linux_22.1_RHEL-8.sh --accept
```

Arm Compiler for Linux uses environment modules to dynamically modify your user environment on Linux. If needed, refer to the [Environment Modules documentation](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#id) for more information.

Set up the environment for example in your .bashrc and add module files. 

`Ubuntu`:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
echo "source /usr/share/modules/init/bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "module use /opt/arm/modulefiles" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

`Red Hat`:

```bash { target="fedora:latest" }
echo "source /usr/share/Modules/init/bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "module use /opt/arm/modulefiles" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

To list available modules:

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc" }
module avail
```

To configure Arm Compiler for Linux:

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc" }
module load acfl/22.1
```

To configure GCC:

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc" }
module load gnu/11.2.0
```

Refer to the [installation instructions](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102621) for more details.

## Setting up product license

You do not require a license to use Arm Compiler for Linux.

## Get started with Arm C/C++ compiler {#armclang}

To get started with the Arm C/C++ Compiler and compile a simple application follow the steps below. 

Check that the correct compiler version is being used:
```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/22.1" }
armclang --version
```

To compile an example program, create a text file named `hello.c` with the contents below.

```C { file_name="hello.c" }
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, Arm World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

To compile the hello-world program use:

```console { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/22.1" }
armclang hello.c -o hello
```

Run the application.

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/22.1" }
./hello
```

The hello-world program will print the string specified in the print statement.

## Get started with Arm Fortran compiler {#fortran}

To get started with the Arm Fortran Compiler and compile a simple application follow the steps below. 

To confirm the installation is complete run:

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/22.1" }
armflang --version
```

To compile an example program, create a text file named hello.f90 with the contents below.

```fortran { file_name="hello.f90" }
program hello
  ! This is a comment line; it is ignored by the compiler
  print *, 'Hello, Arm world!'
end program hello
```

To compile the hello-world program use:

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/22.1" }
armflang hello.f90 -o hello
```

To run the application enter:

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/22.1" }
./hello
```

The hello-world program will print the string specified in the print statement.

## Get started with Arm Performance Libraries

To get started with the [Arm Performance Libraries](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Performance%20Libraries) and learn how to select the optimal library for your system, follow the [Get started with Arm Performance Libraries](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102574) guide.
