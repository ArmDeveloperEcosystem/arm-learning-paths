# Run and evaluate

It is straight forward to compile and run the application, run the commands below:

```bash
cmake -S src -B build
cd build/
make
./sobel_simd_opencv
```

A successful run will output execution time measurement results in microseconds in the terminal for the three implementations, and open four windows showing (as seen below) of the original, non-SIMD, SIMD and OpenCV images of a butterfly.

In the results presented below, a value >1 is faster and a value <1 is slower in comparison to the normalized value. In short, higher values are better.

| | QEMU | | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compiler | GCC 11.3.0 |
| Non-SIMD | 1.00 |
| SIMD     | 0.29 |
| OpenCV   | 0.02 |

The results in the table above have been normalized to the _QEMU Non-SIMD_ value, giving the relative speed-up. 

You observe the following: 
* the non-SIMD implementation is the fastest but does not reflect the performance on an `aarch64` system

Emulation does not give a representative view of how efficiently the algorithms run on Arm, it is only useful for functional purposes, **not** to measure performance

## Closing notes

You have now ported an `x86_64` application to `aarch64`, built and run the ported application on `aarch64` using emulation, well done!

If you have access to Arm hardware, continue to the next section [Evaluating real hardware](/learning-paths/embedded-systems/migration/7_alternative). If you don't have access to Arm hardware you can jump straight to the [Review](/learning-paths/embedded-systems/migration/_review) and test your knowledge.
