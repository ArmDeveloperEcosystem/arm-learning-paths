Arm Cortex-A processors and Linux are the building blocks of many embedded systems. You may be looking for guidance on developing software for embedded systems using Arm processors.

Arm Cortex-A processors deliver a balance of performance and efficiency, which enables fanless designs for the environments required by embedded systems. 

Developers select Arm Cortex-M processors for a variety of reasons:
- Broad Linux support
- Reduced system cost
- Access to firmware and reference software
- Availability of development boards

The high-quality code available in the open-source software community and the ecosystem of Linux applications, development tools, and programming languages reduces risk and shortens time to market.
