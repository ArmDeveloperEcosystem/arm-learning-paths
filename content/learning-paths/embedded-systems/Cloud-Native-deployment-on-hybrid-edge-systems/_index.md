title: Deploy firmware on hybrid edge systems using containers

minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This learning path is for developers interested in learning how to deploy software (embedded applications and firmware) onto other processors in the system, using Linux running on the application core.

learning_objectives:
    - Deploy a containerized embedded application onto an Arm Cortex-M core from an Arm Cortex-A core using *containerd* and *K3s*.
    - Build a firmware container image.
    - Build the hybrid-runtime components.


prerequisites:
    - A valid account with [Arm Virtual Hardware](https://app.avh.arm.com/login)
    - An Arm Linux host machine (if you want to build your own runtime and container image)
