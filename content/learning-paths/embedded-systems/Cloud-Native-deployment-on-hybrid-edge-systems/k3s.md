K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, built to work well in embedded environments. It is optimized for Arm.

## K3s setup

You will use a single node K3s cluster setup. To download K3s and set it up, run the following commands:
```bash
export INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="server --disable traefik --disable metrics-server --disable coredns --disable local-storage --flannel-backend=none --cluster-dns 169.254.0.2 --container-runtime-endpoint=unix://var/run/containerd/containerd.sock"
```
```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC=$INSTALL_K3S_EXEC sh -s -
```
This can take a few minutes to complete.

Make sure K3s is running. A snippet of the expected output is shown below.
```bash
systemctl status k3s
```
```output
* k3s.service - Lightweight Kubernetes
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/k3s.service; enabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: active (running) since <date and time>
       Docs: https://k3s.io
   Main PID: 2069 (k3s-server)
      Tasks: 13
     Memory: 448.0M
     CGroup: /system.slice/k3s.service
             `-2069 "/usr/local/bin/k3s agent"
```
For things to work properly, you need to make K3s aware of the `hybrid-runtime` by configuring this with `containerd`. You find the config file with the K3s example YAML files in GitHub.

Download the K3s demo example YAML files:
```bash
wget https://github.com/smarter-project/hybrid-runtime/releases/download/v1.5/example.tar.gz
```
Extract the files.
```bash
tar -xvf example.tar.gz
```

Create a `containerd` directory under `/etc` and copy the config file there.
```bash
mkdir /etc/containerd
mv example/config.toml /etc/containerd/
```
Restart containerd, and make sure that it's running.
```bash
systemctl restart containerd
systemctl status containerd
```
If you run the `kubectl` command below, you will see that the node is not ready.
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
```output
NAME     STATUS     ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
narsil   NotReady   control-plane,master   18m   v1.29.6+k3s2
```
To fix this, you need to apply a Container Network Interface (CNI). Run the command to use the "smarter_cni", and label the node.
```console
kubectl apply -f example/smarter_cni.yaml
kubectl label node narsil smarter.cni=deploy
```
Re-run the kubectl command.
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
This time, you should be able to see that the node is ready.

```output
root@narsil:~#
NAME     STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
narsil   Ready    control-plane,master   24m   v1.29.6+k3s2
```
## K3s demo

### Deploy SMARTER camera demo

The smarter camera demo is used as an example to show the capabilities of K3s.

First, you need to set a `runtimeClass` in K3s. It allows you to select the container runtime we want to use.
```bash
kubectl apply -f example/runtime_class.yaml
```
Once this is done, we can run the smarter demo:
```bash
kubectl apply -f example/test_hybrid.yaml
```

The `test_hybrid.yaml` file contains the following:
```output
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: example3
  labels:
    k3s-app: example3
spec:
    runtimeClassName: hybrid
    containers:
      - name: example-hybrid-pod3
        image: ghcr.io/smarter-project/smart-camera-hybrid-application/hybrid_app_imx8mp:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```
There are two ways to check that the firmware is running.
1. Run and observe the output.
```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```
```output
root@narsil:~# kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
default       example3            1/1     Running   0              6m57s
kube-system   smarter-cni-wplzn   1/1     Running   3 (141m ago)   4h29m
```
A pod with the name `example3` should be running.

2. Check the Cortex-M Console. If there is any output here, the firmware is running.

### Stop the demo

To stop the demo, run the command shown below. The termination process can take a few minutes.
```bash
kubectl delete pod example3 --grace-period=0 --force
```
Make sure the pod was terminated.
1. Go to the Cortex-M Console and check that there are no new outputs.

2.	Check that the firmware is offline.
```bash
cat /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc0/state
```
Output:
```output
offline
```
3.	Make sure the created pod above was deleted.
```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```
```output
NAMESPACE     NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
kube-system   smarter-cni-wplzn   1/1     Running   3 (143m ago)   4h31m
```
4.	Make sure all the container resources were deleted. The command below should give no output.
```console
ls /var/lib/hybrid-runtime/
```

## Summary

The hybrid-runtime can be used to improve the experience for systems with multiple IPs on a single SoC. You now know how to use cloud tools such as K3s and containerd to deploy and run workloads on hybrid systems using the hybrid-runtime.

If you have an Arm Linux host, you can run the hello world example by following the instructions in the next section.
