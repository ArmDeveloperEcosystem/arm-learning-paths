title: Build a Universal Single Board Computer Rack Mount System

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers and hobbyists who want to build a rack mount system for housing single board computers. 

minutes_to_complete: 120

learning_objectives: 
    - Acquire and print the required materials.
    - Assemble and install the universal SBC rack mount system in a 4U chassis.
    - Install single board computers in the racks.

prerequisites:
    - 3D printer
    - Hack saw or chop saw to cut threaded steel rods
    - 4U server chassis with the insides removed. For example, Rosewill RSV-L4500 4U Industrial Rack-Mount Server Chassis
    - 8-32 stainless steel threaded rods at least 405 mm long. 4 x 405 mm long rods are also required for each bay row. [Example part](https://www.mcmaster.com/98847A009/)
    - 8-32 stainless steel hex nut. 8 per bay row. [Example part](https://www.mcmaster.com/91841A009/)
    - 8-32 stainless steel wing nut. 8 per bay row. [Example part](https://www.mcmaster.com/92001A291/)
    - \#8 stainless steel washer. 8 per bay row. [Example part](https://www.mcmaster.com/90107A010/)
    - 18-8 stainless steel socket head screw. 4 per card. [Example part](https://www.mcmaster.com/91292A016/)
    - 18-8 stainless steel hex nut. 4 per card. [Example part](https://www.mcmaster.com/91828A113/)
    - PETG filament. Others can work, but PETG allows some flex without the risk of snapping
