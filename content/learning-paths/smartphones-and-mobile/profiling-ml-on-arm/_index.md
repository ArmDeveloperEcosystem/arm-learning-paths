title: Profile the Performance of ML models on Arm

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to learn how to profile the performance of ML models running on Arm devices.

learning_objectives: 
    - Profile the execution times of ML models on Arm devices.
    - Profile ML application performance on Arm devices.

prerequisites:
    - An Arm-powered Android smartphone, and a USB cable to connect to it.
    - For profiling the ML inference, [ArmNN](https://github.com/ARM-software/armnn/releases)'s ExecuteNetwork.
    - For profiling the application as a whole, [Arm Performance Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Performance%20Studio)'s Streamline.
    - Android Studio Profiler.
