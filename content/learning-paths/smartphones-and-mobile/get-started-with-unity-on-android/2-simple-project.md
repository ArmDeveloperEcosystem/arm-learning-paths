## Open the sample project

We have Unity installed with Android build support, and we have a spinning cube running too slowly! We can now start to investigate what's wrong.

Open the project in Unity if you haven't already.

Open the _SampleScene_ scene by double-clicking the scene file from the _Project_ tab:

![Open the sample scene#center](images/open-sample-scene.png "Figure 1. Double-click the scene file to open the scene")

We will see a really simple scene with just a few objects:

1. Main Camera
1. Directional Light
1. Cube

We haven't made any modifications to the camera or the directional light but if you click on the Cube object you will see that we have added a custom script called _Spin.cs_.

![Spin component on the Cube object#center](images/inspector-cube-object.png "Figure 2. Custom Spin component on the Cube object")

As you can see, the _Spin_ component looks very basic; it simply applies a rotation to the _Cube_ every frame. The speed of which can be changed using the _Rotation_ parameter.

In the next section you will build the project and deploy it to your Android device. In a real-life case it is good practice to confirm which devices are being affected by which issues.
