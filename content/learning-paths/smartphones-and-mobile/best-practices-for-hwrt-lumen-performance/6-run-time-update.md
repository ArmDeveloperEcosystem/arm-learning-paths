## Reduce Acceleration Structure Run-time Update Cost
The acceleration structure of static meshes is built offline and won't be updated at run-time. However, the acceleration structure of the skinned mesh needs to be updated at run-time and, therefore, it will have some performance cost to update the geometry data in the GPU and rebuild the acceleration structure. When the polygon count of the skinned mesh is high, the update cost could be too high for run-time applications. To reduce the update cost, you can use higher LOD levels of the skinned mesh for ray tracing so there are fewer polygons needed to be updated at run-time.

One thing that needs to be mentioned is that there may be some self-shadowing artifacts if you turn on the ray tracing shadow when using higher LOD levels of the skinned mesh for ray tracing. The artifact is caused by the difference between the rendering mesh and ray tracing mesh.
