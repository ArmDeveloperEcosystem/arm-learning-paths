The Arm Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) is a security feature built into Armv8.5-A and Armv9-A processors. MTE detects buffer overflow errors and use-after-free errors in software. These memory safety issues are the primary source of vulnerabilities.

To learn more about MTE read the article [Memory safety: How Arm Memory Tagging Extension addresses this industry-wide security challenge](https://www.arm.com/blogs/blueprint/memory-safety-arm-memory-tagging-extension).

MTE is helpful for many types of software. It improves the Linux kernel as well as Linux and Android applications.

If you have a recent AArch64 Linux machine you can run a small application to see how it works. 

Hardware availability for MTE is limited, but you can run the example application using [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).

The process below uses Ubuntu 22.04, but other recent versions of Linux can work. 

## Before you begin

Install the meta package which includes software tools for building the example C program:

```console
sudo apt install build-essential -y
```

Install `qemu-user` to run the example on processors which do not support MTE:

```console
sudo apt install qemu-user -y
```

## Create and build the example

Review the comments in the source code to see how MTE works. 

The code demonstrates how to:

- Find out if the processor supports MTE
- Enable synchronous MTE
- Allocate memory with MTE enabled
- Access memory with the default tag of 0
- Generate a random tag and use it for the lock on the memory and the key on the pointer
- Access memory with the generated tag
- Access memory beyond the 16 byte granule and confirm MTE detects a mismatch

1. Use a text editor to copy and paste the C code below to a file named `mte-example.c`:

 *
 * Compile with gcc and use -march=armv8.5-a+memtag

 *
 * Compilation should be done on a recent Arm Linux machine for the .h files to include MTE support.

    /* 
     * Program only reaches this if no SIGSEGV occurs
     */
    printf("...no SIGSEGV was received\n");

    return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
```

2. Compile the example using `gcc`:

```console
gcc mte-example.c -o mte-example -march=armv8.5-a+memtag
```

The executable `mte-example` is now ready to run.

## Run the example 

1. Run the example on the Linux machine and confirm MTE is not supported:

```console
./mte-example
```

The expected output is:

```output
MTE is not supported
```

This occurs because `getauxval()`, the function to query hardware features from applications, does not report the field `HWCAP2_MTE` set. This means MTE is not implemented in the processor. For more information about how to identify hardware features refer to [ARM64 ELF hwcaps](https://docs.kernel.org/arm64/elf_hwcaps.html).

2. Run the application again using `qemu-aarch64`, the userspace program which includes support for MTE:

```console
qemu-aarch64 ./mte-example
```

The expected output is:

```output
MTE is supported
pointer is 0x5501a14000
ptr[0] = 0x41 ptr[1] = 0x42
pointer is now 0x100005501a14000
ptr[0] = 0x43 ptr[1] = 0x44
Expecting SIGSEGV...
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

The application detects MTE is available and memory tagging can be enabled and used.

Notice that the tag value will be different compared to the output above (the tag value is 1). Each time you run the application a random tag will be generated by the `IRG` instruction.

You have learned how to build and run a program with the Memory Tagging Extension on Linux.
