title: Use a PyTorch model for digit classification in Android App

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in learning how to run inference of the pre-trained PyTorch model on Android.

learning_objectives:
    - Creating an Android app and loading the pre-trained mdoel.
    - Preparing an input dataset.
    - Measuring the inference time.

prerequisites:
    - Any computer which can run Python3, Visual Studio Code, and Android Studio this can be Windows, Linux, or macOS.
