        question: >
            Why is ONNX format important in machine learning?
        answers:
            - It is a proprietary format developed exclusively for cloud-based AI systems.
            - It compresses models to reduce memory usage during training.
            - It allows models to be exchanged between different frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.
        correct_answer: 3          
        explanation: >
            The ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format is an open-source standard designed to enable the sharing and use of machine learning models across different frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. It allows models to be exported in a unified format, making them interoperable and ensuring they can run on various platforms or hardware.
