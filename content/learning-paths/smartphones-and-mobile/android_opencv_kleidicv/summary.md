## Summary ##

In this Learning Path, you have created an Android application to processimages using OpenCV accelerated with KleidiCV. 

The application you created demonstrates image processing using OpenCV, focusing on efficiency and modularity. The application includes an ImageOperation enum to define various processing tasks, such as Gaussian blur, resizing, and rotation, each encapsulated with its implementation logic. The ImageProcessor class applies these operations on OpenCV Mat objects, while the PerformanceMetrics class calculates and displays statistical metrics like average and standard deviation of operation durations. The MainActivity class orchestrates the user interface and interaction, allowing users to load an image, select a processing operation from a dropdown menu, and view the processed result along with performance metrics. The design is clean and extensible, highlighting OpenCVâ€™s capabilities and measuring their performance on ARM-based devices.
