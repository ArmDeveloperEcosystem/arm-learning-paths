title: Create, train and optimise a PyTorch model for digit classification on Android

minutes_to_complete: 80

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in learning how to optimise PyTorch model for inference in Android. 

learning_objectives:    
    - Optimise a neural network architecture using quantization and fusing.
    - Use an optimised model in an Android app.

prerequisites:
    - A computer that can run Python3, Visual Studio Code, and Android Studio. The OS can be Windows, Linux, or macOS.
