            Which statement correctly differentiates SharedFlow and StateFlow in Kotlin?
        answers:
            - StateFlow requires an initial value, while SharedFlow does not.
            - SharedFlow is ideal for representing UI state, and StateFlow is best for events.

            - StateFlow and SharedFlow cannot be collected in coroutines.
        correct_answer: 1          
        explanation: >
            StateFlow requires an initial value, while SharedFlow does not.
