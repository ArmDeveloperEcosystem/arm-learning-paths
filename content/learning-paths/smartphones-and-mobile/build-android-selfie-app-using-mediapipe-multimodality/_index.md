who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for mobile application developers interested in learning how to build an Android selfie app with MediaPipe, Kotlin flows and CameraX, following the modern Android architecture design.


learning_objectives: 
    - Architect a modern Android app with a focus on the UI layer.
    - Leverage lifecycle-aware components within the MVVM architecture.
    - Combine MediaPipe's face landmark detection and gesture recognition for a multimodel selfie solution.
    - Use JetPack CameraX to access camera features.
    - Use Kotlin Flow APIs to handle multiple asynchronous data streams.

prerequisites:

    - A recent **physical** Android device (with **front camera**) and a USB **data** cable.
    - Familiarity with Android development concepts.
    - Basic knowledge of modern Android architecture.
    - Basic knowledge of Kotlin programming language, such as [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) and [flows](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html).
