title: Detect faces with OpenCV on arm64-powered Android Devices

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an intermediate topic for developers who are interested in creating Computer Vision Applications with OpenCV on arm64-powered Android Devices. Specifically, we explain how to use OpenCV for face detection with Haar cascade classifier.

learning_objectives:
   - Gain familiarity with OpenCV.   
   - Acquire images from the camera.
   - Use Haar cascade classifier for face detection.

prerequisites:
    - [OpenCV getting started](/content/learning-paths/smartphones-and-mobile/android_opencv_camera)
