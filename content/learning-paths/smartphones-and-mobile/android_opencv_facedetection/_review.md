            What is Haar XML file?
        answers:
            - "It contains device description"
            - "It is used to record images from the camera"
            - "It contains pre-trained data for detecting specific objects, such as faces, eyes, and cars"
        correct_answer: 3
        explanation: >
            A Haar cascade file is an XML file used in computer vision, specifically within the OpenCV library, to perform object detection. It contains pre-trained data for detecting specific objects, such as faces, eyes, and cars. The file is created using the Haar cascade classifier algorithm, which is based on machine learning.
