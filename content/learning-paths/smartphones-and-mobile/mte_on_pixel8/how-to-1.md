Follow the steps below to enable the Developer Options on your Pixel 8:
* On your device, find the Build number option in Settings -> About phone -> Build number

* Tap the Build number option seven times until you see the message "You are now a developer!". This enables Developer options on your device.

* Return to the previous screen and tap on the System option. The just enabled Developer options will be at the bottom.
