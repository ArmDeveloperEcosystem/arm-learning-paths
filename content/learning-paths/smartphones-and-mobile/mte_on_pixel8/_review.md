        question: >
            Which of the statements below is false?
        answers:
            - MTE's working principle is based on a Lock and Key model.
            - Tagging memory implements the lock.
            - Pointers are modified to contain the key.
            - At runtime the CPU checks that the pointer and the metadata tags match. If so, the application crashes in any device.

        explanation: >
            At runtime the CPU checks that the pointer and the metadata tags match, on each load and store. Android apps that incorrectly store information in the top byte of the pointer are guaranteed to break on an MTE-enabled device.
