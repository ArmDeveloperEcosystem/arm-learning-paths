2. Now on the right hand side in the _Inspector_ scroll to the _Battle Env Controller (Script)_ and you should see properties for _Easy Battle Brain_, _Normal Battle Brain_ and _Hard Battle Brain_.

3. Next to the _Easy Battle Brain_ there is a cirle. Click it to pop-up the _Select NN Model_ menu, as per Figure 2.

5. Once the brains are set we can launch the game in the Unity Editor, to make sure everything is working and wired up correctly. If you select "Demo" mode you can see the 2 ML agents battle it out.
