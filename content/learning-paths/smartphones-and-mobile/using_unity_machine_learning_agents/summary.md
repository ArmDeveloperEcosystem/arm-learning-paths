# What We Covered
* ML-Agents can give us great AI and game experiences and a fairly realistic opponent to fight against (depending on difficulty)
* It runs well on Arm devices
* We looked at:
    * Including ML-Agents
    * Training them
    * Running your game with them
    * Deploying to Android
    * Profiling your game, while the ML-Agents are running

# Things to Try
* Deploy to Windows Arm
* Multiple characters: For example 3 vs 1. Train together.
* Co-operative characters: Work with the player.
* Non-battle characters: For different sorts of games.
