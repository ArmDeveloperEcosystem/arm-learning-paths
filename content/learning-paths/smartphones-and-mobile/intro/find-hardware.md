## Find Arm Hardware 

Arm-based processors are widespread in the smartphone industry. Tools such as Arm Mobile Studio help optimize performance of mobile applications. Different mobile devices offer differing levels of performance analysis, depending on the CPU and GPU used.

Processors implemented by Arm will have access to the full list of performance counters specified in the technical reference manual. For other vendor implementations, only the architecturally-defined counters are guaranteed to be available.

Graphics profiling supports any Arm GPU from the Mali-T700 series or later. The Mali-400 series (Utgard family) and Mali-T600 series (first generation Midgard family) products are not supported.

Refer to the Arm Mobile Studio [supported list of devices](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Mobile%20Studio#Supported-Devices) to find devices with Arm CPU implementations and Mali GPUs.
