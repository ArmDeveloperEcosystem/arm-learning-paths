title: Learn about Ray Tracing with Vulkan on Android

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for Vulkan developers who are familiar with rendering and are interested in deploying ray tracing in their applications.

learning_objectives: 
    - Describe how the Vulkan ray tracing API works.
    - Describe how to use ray tracing to implement realistic shadows, reflections, and refractions.
    - Implement basic ray tracing effects in a Vulkan renderer.

prerequisites:
    - An appropriate Android device that supports the required Vulkan extensions (for example, Vivo X100).
    - Knowledge of the Vulkan API.
    - A Vulkan renderer. Most code is generic and should be easy to incorporate into any deferred PBR renderer.
