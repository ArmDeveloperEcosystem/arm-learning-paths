[Arm Performance Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Mobile%20Studio) (formerly known as Arm Mobile Studio) is a performance analysis tool suite for developers to performance test their applications on devices with Mali-based GPUs. It comprises of 4 easy-to-use tools that show you how well your application performs either on off-the-shelf Android devices, or Linux targets. The tools help you to identify problems that might slow down performance, overheat the device, or drain the battery.

| Component | Functionality |
|----------|-------------|
| [Streamline](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Streamline%20Performance%20Analyzer) | Capture a performance profile that shows all the performance counter activity from the device. |
| [Performance Advisor](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Performance%20Advisor) | Generate an easy-to-read performance summary from an annotated Streamline capture, and get actionable advice about where you should optimize. |
| [Frame Advisor](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Frame%20Advisor) | Capture the API calls and rendering from a problem frame and get comprehensive geometry metrics to discover what might be slowing down your application. |
| [Graphics Analyzer](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Graphics%20Analyzer) | Analyze OpenGL ES and Vulkan API calls in your application, to identify rendering defects and investigate problem scenes. |
| [Mali Offline Compiler](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Mali%20Offline%20Compiler) | Analyze how efficiently your shader programs perform on a range of Mali GPUs. |
| [RenderDoc for Arm GPUs](https://renderdoc.org) | The industry-standard tool for debugging Vulkan graphics applications, including early support for Arm GPU extensions and Android features. |

Arm Performance Studio is supported on Windows, Linux, and MacOS hosts. See the [Install Guide](/install-guides/ams) for installation instructions.
