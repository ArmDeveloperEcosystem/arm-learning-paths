Performance Advisor creates an easy-to-read report from a Streamline capture. This helps you quickly understand how your Android application performed on a mobile device.

## Generate a performance report

The supplied [Arm Streamline example capture](/learning-paths/smartphones-and-mobile/ams/streamline_example/) can be used to generate a `Performance Advisor` report.

1. Open a terminal, and navigate to the location of the imported capture.

1. Run the `streamline-cli` command with the `-pa` option on the Streamline capture file (.apc):
    ```command
    streamline-cli -pa "Android - GPU Bound Example.apc"
    ```
    The capture is processed, and a `html` report generated. Warnings shown can be ignored for now:
    ```output
    Importing capture...
    Fetching data...
    Preparing report type html...
    Processing data...
    Generating report type html...
    Report performance_advisor-<timestamp>.html" successfully generated
    ```
    Open the report in a browser and explore the report.
