## Analyze the capture

The captured data can manually explored. Calipers in the timeline view allow you to focus on particular windows of activity. A full description of the capabilities is given in the [Streamline User Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101816/latest/Analyze-your-capture).

Understanding the output of Streamline is key to the usefulness of Streamline. [Android performance triage with Streamline](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102540) describes how to understand the capture from a number of points of view, depending on what information you are trying to extract from it.
