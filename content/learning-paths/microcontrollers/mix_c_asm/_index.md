title: Processing Text in Mixed C/Assembly Language

minutes_to_complete: 20

author_primary: Ronan Synnott

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in efficiently programming microcontrollers with C/Assembly.

learning_objectives: 
    - Write a mixed C program and assembly language subroutines for the microcontroller. 
    - Call the subroutines written in assembly in a C function.  
    - Use Arm register calling conventions when writing subroutines in assembly language.  
    - Use the debugger to view and analyse the processor state.  

prerequisites:
    - Keil MDK IDE
    - Some familiarity with C/Assembly
