minutes_to_complete: 60

author_primary: Ronan Synnott

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who are interested in programming microcontrollers with C/Assembly.

learning_objectives: 
    - Write a mixed C program and assembly language subroutines for the microcontroller. 
    - Call the subroutines written in assembly in a C function.  
    - Use Arm register calling conventions when writing subroutines in assembly language.  
    - Step through the code to understand operation.

prerequisites:
    - Some familiarity with C/Assembly.
