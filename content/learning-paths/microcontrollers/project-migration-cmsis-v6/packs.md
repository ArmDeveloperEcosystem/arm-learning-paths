## Required CMSIS-Packs

For a successful migration to CMSIS v6, you will need to install the following packs on your system.

### Migrating from CMSIS v5 to v6

The ARM.CMSIS.5.x.x pack has been broken up into three different packs that need to be installed to enable migration to CMSIS v6:

- [ARM.CMSIS.6.0.0.pack](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/cmsis-arm)
- [ARM.Cortex_DFP.1.0.0.pack](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/cortex_dfp-arm)
- [ARM.CMSIS-RTX.5.8.0.pack](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/cmsis-rtx-arm)

### Migrating from Keil.ARM_Compiler pack

The Keil.ARM_Compiler pack has been deprecated and its content has moved into two packs that need to be installed to migrate to CMSIS v6:

- [ARM.CMSIS-View.1.1.0.pack](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/cmsis-view-arm)
- [ARM.CMSIS_Compiler.2.0.0.pack](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/cmsis-compiler-arm/versions/)
