## Supported toolchains

CMSIS v6 supports the following toolchains.

- [Arm Compiler for Embedded (v6 and above)](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded)
- [Arm GNU Toolchain (v12 and above)](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain)
- [LLVM Toolchain (v16 and above)](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/LLVM%20Toolchain)
- [IAR Embedded Workbench for Arm (v9.30 and above)](https://www.iar.com/ewarm)

Before migrating your project, please make sure to use one of these toolchains. It cannot be guaranteed that previous versions of the toolchains will work as expected.
