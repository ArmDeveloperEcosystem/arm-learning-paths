## Troubleshooting

This section provides an overview of the most common errors you might encounter along with possible resolutions.

### Missing device

The following error occurs when you try to migrate a project to CMSIS v6 but you have not installed the Cortex_DFP pack:

![Requested device not found for target](./Device_missing.png)

{{% notice Resolution %}}
Install [ARM.Cortex_DFP.1.0.0.pack](https://www.keil.com/pack/ARM.Cortex_DFP_.1.0.0.pack) or above.
{{% /notice %}}

### Error instantiating RTE components

The following error occurs when you try to migrate a Keil RTX-based project but you have not installed the CMSIS-RTX pack:

![Keil RTX5 component not available for target](./CMSIS-RTX_missing.png)

{{% notice Resolution %}}
Install [ARM.CMSIS-RTX.5.8.0.pack](https://www.keil.com/pack/ARM.CMSIS-RTX.5.8.0.pack) or above.

### Missing software components

#### Migrating Keil RTX5-based projects

The following warning is shown in the Validation Output window when you try to migrate a Keil RTX-based project:

![Additional software components required](./OS_Tick_missing.png)

{{% notice Resolution %}}
Use the **Resolve** button to select the missing component automatically.

#### Migrating projects

The following error comes up if the `Device:Startup` component requires a CMSIS-CORE component with a specific v5.x.x version.

![Additional software components required](./install_missing_component.png)

In the Build Output window you might see:

![Validate Run Time Environment warnings/errors detected](./build_output.png)

Despite this warning, the build operation should work normally and the resulting binary will work fine on hardware. If you want to get rid of the error, check one of the following options.

A similar error can come up for any software component. Here is an example using MDK-Middleware:

![Additional software components required](./middleware.png)

{{% notice Resolution %}}
1. Contact the CMSIS-Pack vendor for your device/software component and ask for an updated version without the CMSIS-CORE version requirement. Alterntively, do the following:
2. Edit the device's PDSC file and change for example:
```xml
<require Cclass="CMSIS" Cgroup="CORE" Cversion="5.6.0"/>
```
to
```xml
<require Cclass="CMSIS" Cgroup="CORE"/>
```
{{% /notice %}}

### Updating configuration files

Moving a component from one pack to another has an additional implication. The Event Recorder component, for example, comes with a configuration file (`EventRecorderConf.h`). This configuration file is stored in the project under the RTE/*Cclass* folder. When you switch from one pack to the other, the Cclass name changes and a fresh copy of the original configuration file is copied to your project.

![New configuration files](./configuration_files.png)

{{% notice Resolution %}}
Copy any edits that you made in the old configuration file into the new one.

### Manual migration from Keil.ARM_Compiler pack

As the components from the Keil.ARM_Compiler pack do not have 1:1 replacements, you need to deselect the old components and select the replacements from the two new packs (ARM.CMSIS-Compiler and ARM.CMSIS-View):

1. Compiler:EventRecorder migration

   Deselect the `Compiler:Event Recorder` component and select the `CMSIS-View:Event Recorder` component:

   ![Event Recorder migration](./EventRecorder_migration.png)
2. Compiler:I/O migration

   Deselect any component of `Compiler:I/O` and select the corresponding `CMSIS-Compiler` component:

   ![I/O migration](./IO_migration.png)

   This table helps you to identify the correct components:

   | Compiler:I/O:     | CMSIS-Compiler:            |
   |-------------------|----------------------------|
   | STDERR@Breakpoint | STDERR (API):Breakpoint    |
   | STDERR@ITM        | STDERR (API):ITM           |
   | STDERR@User       | STDERR (API):Custom        |
   | STDIN@Breakpoint  | STDIN (API):Breakpoint     |
   | STDIN@ITM         | STDIN (API):ITM            |
   | STDIN@User        | STDIN (API):Custom         |
   | STDOUT@Breakpoint | STDOUT (API):Breakpoint    |
   | STDOUT@EVR        | STDOUT (API):EventRecorder |
   | STDOUT@ITM        | STDOUT (API):ITM           |
   | STDOUT@User       | STDOUT (API):Custom        |
   | TTY@Breakpoint    | TTY (API):Breakpoint       |
   | TTY@ITM           | TTY (API):ITM              |
   | TTY@User          | TTY (API):Custom           |

{{% notice Note %}}
All CMSIS-Compiler components require CMSIS-Compiler:Core to be present.

### Linker errors using the RTX5 library

In CMSIS v5, the RTX5 libraries were built using the compiler options `-fshort-enums` and `-fshort-wchar`. In CMSIS v6, the default compiler options are different. If you are using the new libraries with old build settings, you will encounter the linker error `L6242W`:

```
.\Blinky.axf: Error: L6242E: Cannot link object Itx timer.o as its attributes are incompatible with the image attributes.
   ... wchart-16 clashes with wchart-32.
   ... packed-enum clashes with enum_is_int
```

{{% notice Resolution %}}
In ÂµVision, go to **Project - Options for Target** and click on the **C/C++ (AC6)** tab. Unselect **Short enums/wchar** and rebuild the project:

![Unselect short enums/wchar](./compiler_settings.png)

{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice Note %}}
If you are using libraries in your project that have been built with short enums/wchars (for example the MDK-Middleware), you need to use the RTX5 source code variant in your project as otherwise the linker will fail, even when unselecting the "Short enums/wchar" option.
