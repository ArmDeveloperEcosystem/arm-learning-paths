The steps below explain how to load programs and do interactive debugging by connecting the Debug pins of the Raspberry Pi Pico. 

This is helpful because holding the BOOTSEL button and connecting the USB cable is tedious during debugging sessions. 

Instead, applications can be loaded using the debug pins. The debug interface consists of 3 pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico which implement Serial Wire Debug (SWD). SWD is a standard interface on Cortex-M microcontrollers.

This section covers how to:
- Connect the debug pins
- Load and run a program from the command line without configuring the Pico as a USB storage device
- Use gdb for interactive debugging

## Connect the debug wires

The easiest way to connect the debug pins is by using the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi 3/4/400. 

To use the Raspberry Pi 3/4/400 GPIO pins use jumper wires to connect the pins in the table below.

| Raspberry Pi 3/4/400  | Raspberry Pi Pico |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| GND (Pin 20)  | SWD GND | 
| GPIO24 (Pin 18)   | SWDIO |
| GPIO25 (Pin 22) | SWCLK |

If a Raspberry Pi 3/4/400 is not available, the debug interface can be connected to another Raspberry Pi Pico which serves as a debug probe. 

The second Pico bridges the development computer to the Pico running the program to be debugged. The Pico serving as the debug probe runs a software application called Picoprobe. More information about using two Pico boards is available in [Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf), search for Picoprobe.

After making the connections attach the micro USB cable between the Raspberry Pi 3/4/400 and the Pico. 

## Run an application from the command line

When using the debug interface, the application .elf file is used instead of the .uf2 file. It is located in the build directory along with the other files generated by the build process.

Program loading is done using openocd. Two configuration files are passed to openocd which describe the hardware. These are provided by the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK. After the configuration files, a series of commands are passed to openocd to load the application and run it. 

Run the same hello world application used in a [previous step](/learning-paths/microcontrollers/rpi_pico/hello/). If `build/hello.elf` is not present, rebuild the application.

```console
openocd -f $PICO_SDK_PATH/../openocd/tcl/interface/raspberrypi-swd.cfg -f $PICO_SDK_PATH/../openocd/tcl/target/rp2040.cfg -c "program build/hello.elf verify reset exit"
```

Openocd copies the .elf file to the Pico. This replaces copying the .uf2 to the USB storage.

The program output is the same as before. Use minicom to see the print statements from USB serial. 

```console
sudo minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyACM0
```

## Use gdb for interactive debug

Interactive debugging with gdb can be done with a slight modification to the openocd commands. 

Make sure the application was compiled for debugging. This is done by setting the Debug build type. 

```console
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
cd ..
```

Removing the command string causes openocd to wait for a debugger connection from gdb. 

```console
 openocd -f $PICO_SDK_PATH/../openocd/tcl/interface/raspberrypi-swd.cfg -f $PICO_SDK_PATH/../openocd/tcl/target/rp2040.cfg
 ```

In another terminal, start gdb.

```console
gdb-multiarch build/hello.elf 
```

Once gdb starts, a complete debugging session is shown below, the (gdb) prompt is shown, enter only the commands after the (gdb) prompt.

```console
(gdb) target remote localhost:3333

All gdb commands are available to single step, inspect memory, display registers, disassemble, and print variables. Feel free to search for gdb tutorials to learn more about using gdb. 

## Summary 

The Raspberry Pi Pico debug interface can be used to load programs and debug them with gdb. There is need to hold the BOOTSEL button and copy the .uf2 file to USB storage every time the program is changed.
