If using Keil μVision, go to [Build example with Keil μVision](/learning-paths/microcontrollers/cmsis-dsp/mdk5/).

## Clone the repository to get the example code

The source code of the example is available within the `CMSIS-DSP` Github repository.

Open a command prompt, and navigate to an appropriate folder.

Clone the repository.

``` command
git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-DSP
```

## Import example into Keil Studio

Keil Studio projects are based on the [CMSIS Solution](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/YML-Input-Format.md) standard.

The example provided is in μVision `.uvprojx` format. The Keil Studio VS Code Extensions include functionality to import such projects.

Launch VS Code IDE, and start a New Window (`Ctrl` + `Shift`  + `N`).

Select the `CMSIS` extension, and click on `Convert a μVision Project`.

Browse to the above cloned repository, and locate the `CMSIS-DSP/Examples/ARM/arm_dotproduct_example` folder.

Select the `arm_dotproduct_example.uvprojx` file, and open the newly created `csolution`.

## Configure solution environment

VS Code allows complete configurability of all aspects of the project.

Locate `vcpkg-configuration.json` within the project. This file defines the components used.

Right-click on this file, and select `Configure Arm Tools Environment` to open the configuration panel.

From the various pull-downs, ensure that the most up to date versions of the following are selected:

* Arm CMSIS-Toolbox
* Arm Compiler for Embedded
* Arm Debugger
* Arm Virtual Hardware for Cortex-M based on Fast Models
* Kitware's cmake tool
* Ninja Build

Others can be set as `None` as they are not needed for this example.

If you open `vcpkg-configuration.json` in the text editor you will see these set as selected. Close the file to save.

All necessary components will be downloaded and installed as necessary (if not already installed).

## Configure CMSIS options

Select `CMSIS` from the Extensions icon list. You will see the project structure.

Move cursor over the top-level, and click on `Manage Software Components`. This is the view to add CMSIS Software Packs to your project.

Select `CMSIS > Core`, `CMSIS > DSP`, and `Device > Startup` (these are likely selected by default).

Close this view to save.

## Configure build options

Move cursor over the top level project, and click `Open File` to open the `cproject.yml` file, which defines the build options for the different targets.

Locate the `Link` settings for the `ARMCM4FP` and `ARMCM55FPMVE` targets (and any other targets you wish to build), and add the following to the linker options list if not already present:
```command
            - --entry=Reset_Handler
```

## Configure build context {#build}

The imported example includes build targets for various Arm processors. 

Click on the `Manage Solution Settings` gear icon to open the `csolution.yml` file that defines the project.

Set `ARMCM3` as the `Active Target`.

Click the `Build` hammer icon to build for Cortex-M3.

## Run example on Cortex-M3 FVP {#run}

Select `Run and Debug` from the Extensions icon list.

Click the gear icon to open `launch.json`. This is the file that defines the debug instance.

Right-click on `launch.json` and select `Open Run and Debug Configuration`.

From the `Selected Configuration` pull-down, select `New Configuration` > `Launch FVP`. Edit the `Configuration Name` if desired.

From the `Target` > `Configuration Database Entry` pull-down, select `MPS2_Cortex_M3` > `Cortex-M3`.

Other fields can be left as default. Close the file to save. Observe that `launch.json` has been updated.

Select this configuration from the `Run and Debug` pulldown, and `Start Debugging` (`F5`).

The FVP will launch with the example code, and stop at `main()`.

Set breakpoint(s) at the `while(1);` terminations at the end of `main()`.

Note the number of instructions executed to this point, as shown in the FVP display (`184` in the example below):

![FVP Display #center](images/fvp.png)

Click `Continue` (or press `F5`) to run the example to this breakpoint, and stop.

Note the number of instructions executed, and subtract the initialization cycle count.

Terminate the debug session (`Stop` button, `Ctrl`+`F5`).

## Run example on Cortex-M55 FVP

We will now build for the `ARMCM55_FP_MVE` target (build for Cortex-M55). This build makes use of the [Helium](https://www.arm.com/technologies/helium) vectorizing extensions that Cortex-M55 supports.

Repeat the steps above to [build](#build) for `ARMCM55FPMVE`.

Repeat the steps above to [run](#run) on `Corstone-300 FVP`.

If the `Corstone-300 FVP` is not available in the pulldown, you will need to manually configure in `launch.json`. Note the `cdbEntry` line in the below.
```json
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "M55",
            "type": "arm-debugger.fvp",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${command:arm-debugger.getApplicationFile}",
            "cdbEntry": "Arm SubSystem FVP::Corstone SSE-300 Ethos-U55 (MPS3)::Bare Metal Debug::Bare Metal Debug::Cortex-M55"
        },
    ]
```
You should be a dramatic performance improvement over Cortex-M3.

{{% notice  Note%}}
The FVPs are instruction accurate but not cycle accurate.

The instruction count is used here to illustrate relative performance to a high granularity.
