TinyML represents a significant shift in machine learning deployment. 

Unlike traditional machine learning, which typically depends on cloud-based servers or high-powered hardware, TinyML is tailored to function on devices with limited resources, constrained memory, low power, and less processing capabilities. 

TinyML has gained popularity because it enables AI applications to operate in real-time, directly on the device, with minimal latency, enhanced privacy, and the ability to work offline. 

This shift opens up new possibilities for creating smarter and more efficient embedded systems.

## Module Overview 

This Learning Path is about TinyML, applying machine learning to devices with limited resources like microcontrollers. It serves as a starting point for learning how cutting-edge AI technologies may be put on even the smallest of devices, making Edge AI more accessible and efficient. 

You will learn how to setup on your host machine and target device to facilitate compilation and ensure smooth integration across all devices.

## Examples of Arm-based devices and applications

There are many devices you can use for TinyML projects. Some of them are listed below.

### Raspberry Pi 4 and 5

Raspberry Pi single-board computers are excellent for prototyping TinyML projects. They are commonly used for prototyping machine learning projects at the edge, such as in object detection and voice recognition for home automation.

### NXP i.MX RT microcontrollers

NXP i.MX RT microcontrollers are low-power microcontrollers that can handle complex TinyML tasks while maintaining energy efficiency, making them ideal for applications like wearable healthcare devices and environmental sensors.

### STM32 microcontrollers

STM32 microcontrollers are used in industrial IoT applications for predictive maintenance. These microcontrollers are energy-efficient and capable of running TinyML models for real-time anomaly detection in factory machinery.

### Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

The Arduino Nano, equipped with a suite of sensors, supports TinyML and is ideal for small-scale IoT applications, such as detecting environmental changes and movement patterns.

### Edge Impulse

In addition to hardware, there are software platforms that can help you build TinyML applications. 

Edge Impulse platform offers a suite of tools for developers to build and deploy TinyML applications on Arm-based devices. It supports devices like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and STMicroelectronics boards.
