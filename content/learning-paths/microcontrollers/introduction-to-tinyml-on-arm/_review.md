            1. What is TinyML?
        answers:
            - "Machine learning models designed to run on large, cloud-based servers."
            - "Machine learning models designed to run on resource-constrained devices like microcontrollers and edge devices."
            - A cloud service for deep learning model deployment.
            - A special type of machine learning for virtual reality applications
        correct_answer: 2                 
        explanation: >
            TinyML is specifically designed to operate on devices with limited computational resources.

        question: >
            2.	Which of the following is NOT a benefit of deploying TinyML on Arm devices? 
        answers:
            - "Enhanced data privacy"
            - "Low latency"
            - High power consumption
            - Cost-effectiveness
        correct_answer: 3                  
        explanation: >
            High power consumption is not a benefit, one of the key advantages of TinyML on Arm devices is their ability to perform tasks with very low power usage.

            3.	Which of the following is an example of TinyML in healthcare?
        answers:
            - Smart sensors for soil moisture monitoring.
            - Wearable devices monitoring vital signs and detecting heart arrhythmias.
            - Predictive maintenance for factory machines.
            - Object detection for smart home cameras.
        correct_answer: 2          
        explanation: >
            Wearable devices that monitor vital signs and detect heart arrhythmias show TinyML's ability to perform complex analyses in real-time on resource-constrained device.
