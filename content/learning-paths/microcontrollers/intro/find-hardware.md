Evaluation boards (also known as starter kits) are available from various Arm partners to support their devices. They are used for early software development, prototyping, and demonstration. They come in a wide variety of feature sets and price points. They are typically used stand-alone as provided.

Other boards, often referred to as edge computing boards or modules, or as single board computers (SBCs), can be directly used in a final product. These boards typically have a small form-factor so as to be easily designed into commercial products. Debug interfaces, and other features beneficial for early software may not be available.

Microcontrollers based on Arm Cortex-M processors are available from various Arm partners. The selection is very broad.

The [Keil MDK device database](https://www.keil.arm.com/devices/) lists 10000+ such devices that are supported by this toolchain.

Arm Keil also provides a [database of development boards](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/) along with example software projects.
