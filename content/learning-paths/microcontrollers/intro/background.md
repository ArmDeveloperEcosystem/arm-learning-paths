Microcontrollers built with Arm Cortex-M 32-bit processors are everywhere. They are found in products ranging from small sensors to large servers. You may be looking for guidance on developing software for Arm microcontrollers or migrating applications from other architectures. 

[Arm Cortex-M processors](https://www.arm.com/markets/iot) provide a variety of performance and power alternatives. There are thousands of microcontroller devices and hundreds of boards available using Cortex-M.

Developers select Arm Cortex-M processors for a variety of reasons:
- Energy efficiency
- Ease of use
- Higher performance
- Reduced system cost
- Availability of development boards

The scale of the software developer community and the ecosystem collaborating on standards reduces risk and shortens time to market.

The Arm Cortex-M ecosystem offers a wide range of software options, including broad development tool and RTOS support.

The [Common Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS)](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/cmsis) is a vendor-independent abstraction layer for microcontrollers. CMSIS simplifies software reuse and reduces the learning curve for microcontroller developers.
