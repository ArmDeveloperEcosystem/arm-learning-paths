## Use vcpkg

The following commands help you to work with `vcpkg`. The most important one is `activate` as this activates all tools specified by the configuration file.

### Activate vcpkg

#### Activate tools specified by vcpkg-configuration.json

```bash { output_lines = "2-8" }
vcpkg activate

warning: vcpkg-artifacts is experimental and may change at any time.
Artifact                                Version Status    Dependency Summary                                             
arm:tools/open-cmsis-pack/cmsis-toolbox 2.0.0   installed            Arm distributed Open-CMSIS-Pack cli tools           
arm:compilers/arm/armclang              6.20.0  installed            Arm Compiler for Embedded                           
microsoft:tools/kitware/cmake           3.25.2  installed            Kitware's cmake tool                                
microsoft:tools/ninja-build/ninja       1.10.2  installed            Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed.
```

#### Activate tools using a vcpkg-configuration.json file elsewhere

```bash
 vcpkg activate --project ../my-config.json
```

#### Deactivate artifacts specified by vcpkg-configuration.json

```bash { output_lines = "2-4" }
vcpkg deactivate

warning: vcpkg-artifacts is experimental and may change at any time.
Deactivating: /Users/myuser/projects/myproject
```

#### Activating tools without vcpkg-configuration.json

```bash { output_lines = "2-5" }
vcpkg use cmsis-toolbox

warning: vcpkg-artifacts is experimental and may change at any time.
Artifact                                Version Status    Dependency Summary                                  
arm:tools/open-cmsis-pack/cmsis-toolbox 2.0.0   installed            Arm distributed Open-CMSIS-Pack cli tools
```

#### Retrieve all available versions of a tool

```bash { output_lines = "2-14" }
vcpkg use open-cmsis-pack

warning: vcpkg-artifacts is experimental and may change at any time.
error: Unable to resolve artifact: open-cmsis-pack

### List available artifacts

#### For example, tools

```bash { output_lines = "2-16" }
vcpkg find artifact tools

```

#### For example, compilers

```bash { output_lines = "2-9" }
vcpkg find artifact compilers

warning: vcpkg-artifacts is experimental and may change at any time.
Artifact                                                         Version        Summary

```

### Working with the vcpkg-configuration.json file

#### Create a new vcpkg-configuration.json file

```shell
vcpkg new --application
```

#### Add artifact to vcpkg-configuration.json file

```shell
 vcpkg add artifact cmake
```

#### Remove artifact to vcpkg-configuration.json file

```shell
 vcpkg remove microsoft:tools/kitware/cmake
```

#### Update a registry

For example, the `arm` registry:

```shell
vcpkg x-update-registry arm
```

Before using the Arm Compiler, you need to activate a license. The next step shows how to do that.
