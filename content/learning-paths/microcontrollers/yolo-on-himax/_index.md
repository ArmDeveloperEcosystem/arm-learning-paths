title: Run Yolo computer vision model on a Himax microcontroller

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This is an introduction topic for beginners on how to run a computervision application on an embedded device from Himax. This example uses an off-the-shelf Himax WiseEye2 module which is based on the Arm Cortex-M55 and Ethos-U55.

learning_objectives: 
    - Run a you-only-look-once (Yolo) model using off-the-shelf hardware based on the Arm Cortex-M55 and Ethos-U55.
    - Learn how to build the Himax SDK and generate firmware image file.
    - Learn how to update firmware on edge device (Himax WiseEye2).
    
prerequisites:
    - Seeed Grove Vision AI V2 Module
    - OV5647-62 Camera module and included FPC cable
    - A USB-C cable
    - A Linux/Windows-based PC on an x86 archiecture.
