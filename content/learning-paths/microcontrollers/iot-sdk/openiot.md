[Arm Total Solutions for IoT](https://www.arm.com/markets/iot/total-solutions-iot) provide reference software stacks, integrating various Arm technologies, such as [Arm Trusted Firmware-M](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Trusted%20Firmware-M) and the [Arm ML Evaluation Kit (MLEK)](https://review.mlplatform.org/plugins/gitiles/ml/ethos-u/ml-embedded-evaluation-kit).

The Open-IoT-SDK is designed to be used with [Arm Virtual Hardware (AVH)](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/simulation/virtual-hardware), which provides [Corstone-300](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Corstone-300) Virtual Hardware.

## Before you begin

Follow the [Arm Virtual Hardware](/install-guides/avh/) install guide for set up instructions. 

Use your AWS account to create an EC2 instance (virtual machine) from the Arm Virtual Hardware (AVH) Amazon Machine Instance (AMI). 

Once your AVH instance is running and you can connect using SSH you are ready to start. Everything can be done from a Linux terminal, and no graphical desktop is needed.

## Install the required software

In your AVH instance, install the required python software:

```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.8-venv -y
sudo cp /usr/local/bin/pip3.8 /usr/bin
```

Install Python packages:

```console
python3.8 -m pip install imgtool cbor2
python3.9 -m pip install imgtool cffi intelhex cbor2 cbor pytest click
```

Modify the `PATH` environment variable to make python user packages visible in the shell:

```console
export PATH=$PATH:/home/ubuntu/.local/bin
```

## Clone the example repository

Clone the example repository, and navigate to the `v8m` folder.

```console
git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/open-iot-sdk.git
cd open-iot-sdk/v8m
```

## Build an example

The projects are located in the `examples` folder. Review the list of available projects:

```console
ls examples
```

The output is:

```output
blinky  keyword  speech
```

Use the `ats.sh` script to build the examples. 

The `blinky` example demonstrates how to use Trusted Firmware-M to create secure and non-secure partitions, and blink the LED from the non-secure code.

Build `blinky` example by running:

```console
./ats.sh build blinky
```

Ignore any warnings from the build. 

## Run the example on Arm Virtual Hardware

To run the `blinky` example on `Arm Virtual Hardware for Corstone-300`:

```console
./ats.sh run blinky
```
Observe in the output that the system boots through Arm Trusted Firmware (default build uses dummy keys), before the main application.

The output will be similar to:

```output

[INF] Beginning BL2 provisioning
[WRN] TFM_DUMMY_PROVISIONING is not suitable for production! This device is NOT SECURE
