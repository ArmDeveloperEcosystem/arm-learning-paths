title: Convert uvprojx-based projects to csolution

minutes_to_complete: 10

who_is_this_for: This is a topic for users of µVision who want to migrate to the new project format (csolution) required by CMSIS-Toolbox.

learning_objectives: 
    - Import, convert, and build uvprojx-based projects in Keil Studio.
    - Convert uvprojx-based projects in µVision.
    - Convert and build uvprojx-based projects on the command line.

prerequisites:
    - Install [Keil Studio](/install-guides/keilstudio_vs/) on your machine.
    - Install [µVision](/install-guides/mdk/) on your machine.
    - Install [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html) for the command line flow.
    - The &micro;Vision project must use Arm Compiler 6 as the default toolchain. Arm Compiler 5 is not supported.
