## Try the end-to-end workflow

This section provides hands-on instructions for you to deploy pre-trained PaddlePaddle models on the Corstone-300 Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) included with Arm Virtual Hardware.

The steps involved in the model deployment are shown in the figure below:

## Deploy PaddleOCR text recognition model on the Corstone-300 FVP included with Arm Virtual Hardware

Start by launching the [Arm Virtual Hardware AMI](/install-guides/avh/).

Alternatively, you can also download the Corstone-300 FVP from the [Arm Ecosystem FVP](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-ecosystem-fvps) page. For installation instructions see [Arm Ecosystem FVPs](/install-guides/ecosystem_fvp/).

The code for this [project](https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/Paddle-examples-for-AVH/tree/main/OCR-example), is available to download from [ArmDeveloperEcosystem](https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/Paddle-examples-for-AVH) GitHub repository as well as [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/tree/dygraph/deploy/avh)â€™s GitHub repository (under the dygraph branch). 

Start by cloning the code respository on your running AVH AMI instance:

```console
git clone https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/Paddle-examples-for-AVH.git
cd Paddle-examples-for-AVH/OCR-example/Text-recognition-example
```

In this directory, there is a script named [run_demo.sh](https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/Paddle-examples-for-AVH/blob/main/OCR-example/run_demo.sh) that automates the entire process described in the End-to-end workflow diagram. 

The `run_demo.sh` script automatically builds and executes the English text recognition application on the Corstone-300 platform included with Arm Virtual Hardware. Here is a list of steps performed by this script:

- Step 1. Set up build environment
- Step 2. Download a trained PaddleOCR text recognition model
- Step 3. Use TVMC to compile the model and generate code for the Arm Cortex-M processor
- Step 4. Process resources for building the application image
- Step 5. Build the target application using Makefiles
- Step 6. Run application binary on Corstone-300 FVP included in AVH

Training the model usually takes a lot of time. In step 2, an already trained English text recognition model named [ocr_en.tar](https://paddleocr.bj.bcebos.com/tvm/ocr_en.tar) is used.
 
By default, the script uses the image shown below (QBHOUSE) as an example to verify the inference results on the Corstone-300 FVP with Arm Cortex-M55.

You can now run the trained PaddleOCR text recognition model on the Corstone-300 FVP included on the AVH AMI with the following command:

```console
./run_demo.sh
```

The output from running the application on the Corstone-300 FVP is shown below:

```
The text recognition results are consistent with the input image text content `QBHOUSE` and has a high confidence score of 0.986746.

You have successfully deployed a PP-OCRv3 English recognition model directly on the Corstone-300 FVP with the Arm Cortex-M55.
