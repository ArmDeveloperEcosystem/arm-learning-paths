## Run an example

To run an example on the Corstone-300 FVP target, launch the FVP executable with `-a` to specify the software application.

To run the key word spotting example `ethos-u-kws.axf` compiled with `gcc` use:

- on your computer with the FVP installed

```console
FVP_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55 -a cmake-build-mps3-sse-300-ethos-u55-128-gnu/bin/ethos-u-kws.axf
```

- on Arm Virtual Hardware

```console
VHT_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55 -a cmake-build-mps3-sse-300-ethos-u55-128-gnu/bin/ethos-u-kws.axf
```
When the example is running, a telnet instance will open allowing you to interact with the example.

It may take some time to initialize the terminal, please be patient. 

If you see warnings regarding loading the image, these can likely be ignored.

Use the menu to control the application. For the key word spotting application enter 1 to classify the next audio clip.

The results of the classification will appear in the visualization window of the FVP. 

The display shows a 98% chance of the audio clips sound was down.

End the simulation by pressing Control-C in the terminal where to started the FVP.

You now have the ML Evaluation Kit examples running. Experiment with the different examples provided.

## Addendum: Setting model parameters

You can specify additional parameters to configure certain aspects of the simulated Corstone-300.

### List parameters

List the available parameters by running the FVP executable with the `--list-params` option, for example:

```console
FVP_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55 --list-params > parameters.txt
```

{{% notice Note %}}
If you are running with Arm Virtual Hardware substitute `VHT_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55` as the executable name.
{{% /notice %}}

Open the file `parameters.txt` to see all of the possible parameters and the default values. 

### Set parameters

Individual parameters can be set with the `-C` command option. 

For example, to put the Ethos-U component into fast execution mode:

```console
FVP_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55 -a cmake-build-mps3-sse-300-ethos-u55-128-gnu/bin/ethos-u-kws.axf -C ethosu.extra_args="--fast"
```
{{% notice Note %}}
Do not use fast execution mode whilst benchmarking performance.
{{% /notice %}}

To set multiple parameters it may be easier to list them in a text file (without `-C`) and use `-f` to specify the file.

For example, use a text editor to create a file named `options.txt` with the contents:

```console
mps3_board.visualisation.disable-visualisation=1
ethosu.extra_args="--fast"
```

Run the FVP with the `-f` option and the `options.txt` file:

```console
FVP_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55 -a cmake-build-mps3-sse-300-ethos-u55-128-gnu/bin/ethos-u-kws.axf -f options.txt
```
