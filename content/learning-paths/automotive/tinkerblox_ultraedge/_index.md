title: UltraEdge HPC-I execution fabric for AI & mixed workloads

draft: true
cascade:
    draft: true

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: Business teams targeting lower TCO of computing infrastructure through higher utilization of CPU and/or CPU-GPU install bases. R&D and Engineering teams looking for most efficient use of CPU/CPU-GPU infrastructure. Innovation teams looking to maximize edge resources to host new-age AI on constrained environments. Development teams looking at alternative packaging tech – run-time environments to build next generation workloads.

learning_objectives:
  -   Understand the layered architecture of UltraEdge  **core**, **boost**, and **prime**.
  -   Build applications using the **UltraEdge MicroStack**
  -   Deploy the MicroPacs on **Linux-based compute systems** and scale to
      cloud or data-centre environments.
  -   Optimize performance for **edge-cloud scenarios**, enabling near
      real-time data flows.


prerequisites:
  -   Experience using **Linux** on embedded or SBC platforms.
  -   Understanding of **container runtimes** (containerd) and **CNI
      networking**.
  -   Basic knowledge of **communication protocols** (MQTT, HTTP, etc.).
  -   (Optional but helpful) dFamiliarity with **edge-cloud
      architectures** and **data-flow orchestration**.
