title: Deploy Open AD Kit containerized autonomous driving simulation on Arm Neoverse

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for automotive developers, aimed at helping them accelerate autonomous driving software development before automotive hardware is available.

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand the SOAFEE architecture and its role in supporting Shift-Left software development strategies to optimize the autonomous driving development process.
    - Use the Autoware Open AD Kit simulation environment.
    - Run containerized workloads on Arm Neoverse processors with Docker, supporting execution on both cloud-based and on-premise servers.
    - Explore advanced configurations and future development prospects.
prerequisites:
    - An Arm Neoverse cloud instance, or a local Arm Neoverse Linux computer with at least 16 CPUs and 32GB of RAM.
    - Familiarity with Docker and Docker Compose.
