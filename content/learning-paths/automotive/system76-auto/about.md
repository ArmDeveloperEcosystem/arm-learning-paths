### About the Thelio Astra

Thelio Astra is an Arm-based desktop computer designed by System76 for autonomous vehicle development and other general-purpose Arm software development.

Thelio Astra uses the Ampere Altra processor, which is based on the Arm Neoverse N1 CPU, and ships with the Ubuntu operating system.

An NVIDIA GPU is included for high performance graphics, and the system can be configured with up to 512 GB of RAM and up to 16 TB of storage.

Some of the benefits of using a Thelio Astra for automotive development include:

- Access to native performance - you can execute build and test cycles directly on Arm Neoverse processors, eliminating the performance overhead and complexities associated with instruction emulation and cross-compilation. 

- Improved virtualization - familiar virtualization and container tools on Arm simplify the development and test process. 

- Better cost-effectiveness - there are cost savings of having a local computer with a high core count, large memory, and plenty of storage. 

- Enhanced compatibility - support for Arm CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs eliminates the need for Arm instruction emulation, which simplifies the developer process and overall experience. 

- Optimized developer process - the development process can be optimized by enabling you to run large software stacks on your local machine, making it easier to fix issues and improve performance.
