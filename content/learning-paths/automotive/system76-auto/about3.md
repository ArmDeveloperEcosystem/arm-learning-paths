## About Parsec

There are a number of example applications which demonstrate the software stack running the reference hardware system modeled by a Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP). The Parsec demo is explained below. 

The [Parsec-enabled TLS demo](https://arm-auto-solutions.docs.arm.com/en/v1.1/design/applications/parsec_enabled_tls.html) illustrates a HTTPS session. A simple web page is transferred using a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection.

Parsec, or Platform AbstRaction for SECurity, is an open-source initiative that provides a common API to hardware security and cryptographic services.

This enables applications to interact with the secure hardware of a device without requiring knowledge of the specific details of the hardware itself. The Parsec abstraction layer makes it easier to develop secure applications that can run on different devices and platforms. Â  

You can follow the instructions in the next section to run the Parsec demo.
