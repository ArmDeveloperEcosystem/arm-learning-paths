## What functional safety means for developers

Functional safety helps systems detect faults and respond in ways that keep people and equipment safe. It ensures that even when errors occur, the system transitions into a known, safe state to prevent harm.

This concept is foundational in domains like automotive, autonomous driving, medical devices, industrial control, robotics, and aerospace. In these systems, failures can have severe real-world consequences.

In software development, functional safety focuses on minimizing risks through careful design, rigorous testing, and thorough validation. The goal is to make sure that critical systems behave predictably, reliably, and verifiably, even under fault conditions.

To design for functional safety, developers must consider:

- Error detection mechanisms  
- Exception handling strategies  
- Redundant system design  
- Development processes that align with safety standards


In the following sections, you'll learn how to apply these principles throughout the software lifecycle, from early risk assessment and architectural design to runtime isolation and ISO 26262 compliance.
