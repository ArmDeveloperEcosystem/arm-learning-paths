title: Prototype safety-critical isolation for autonomous driving systems on Neoverse

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for automotive engineers developing safety-critical systems. You'll learn how to accelerate ISO 26262-compliant development workflows using Arm-based cloud compute, containerized simulation, and DDS-based communication.

learning_objectives: 
    - Apply functional safety principles, including risk prevention, fault detection, and ASIL compliance, to build robust, certifiable automotive systems
    - Use DDS and a publish-subscribe architecture for low-latency, scalable, and fault-tolerant communication in autonomous driving systems
    - Implement distributed development by separating the simulation platform into independent,     safety-isolated components

prerequisites:
    - Access to two Arm-based Neoverse cloud instances, or a local Arm Neoverse Linux system with at least 16 CPUs and 32 GB of RAM
    - Completion of the [Deploy Open AD Kit containerized autonomous driving simulation on Arm Neoverse](/learning-paths/automotive/openadkit1_container/) Learning Path
    - Basic familiarity with Docker
