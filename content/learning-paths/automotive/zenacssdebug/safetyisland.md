## Debug Safety Island code from beginning

The Safety Island (Cortex-R82AE) is released from reset by the RSE code, and so the RSE code must proceed to that point before the Safety Island core can execute.

### Launch FVP

If necessary, restart the FVP in the reset state as before, and reconnect `RSE`.

```command
kas shell -c "../layers/meta-arm/scripts/runfvp -t tmux --verbose -- --iris-server --iris-port 7100"
```

Set up the `SI` connection in a similar way as the `RSE` connection. Use the following commands in the `Debugger` pane. This will load debug symbols and perform the necessary path substitution. You can then set a breakpoint on the entry of the `SI` code, `arch_exception_reset`.

``` text
stop
add-symbol-file /arm-auto-solutions/build/tmp_baremetal/deploy/images/fvp-rd-aspen/si0_ramfw.elf
set substitute-path /usr/src/debug/scp-firmware/2.14.0/ /arm-auto-solutions/build/tmp_baremetal/work/fvp_rd_aspen-poky-linux/scp-firmware/2.14.0/git/
b arch_exception_reset
```

Exact paths may differ for your set up.

### Start execution

Select the `RSE` connection in the `Debug Control` pane, and start execution (this will be unavailable in the `SI` connection, as that is currently powered down).

The `RSE` code will run until the point that the `SI` is enabled. This is reflected in the output log.

``` output
[INF] BL2: SI CL0 post load start
```
