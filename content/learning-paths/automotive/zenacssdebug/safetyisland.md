## Debug Safety Island code from beginning

The Safety Island subsystem based on the Cortex-R82AE is released from reset by RSE code. To debug Safety Island from first instruction, you must let the RSE (Cortexâ€‘M55) code reach the point where it enables Safety Island on the Zena CSS FVP.

## Launch the FVP and reconnect RSE

If necessary, start (or restart) the FVP held at reset and reconnect the RSE model connection in Arm Development Studio:

```command
kas shell -c "../layers/meta-arm/scripts/runfvp -t tmux --verbose -- --iris-server --iris-port 7100"
```

{{% notice Tip %}}
For remote debugging, add `-A` and ensure the chosen Iris port (default `7100`) is reachable.

## Connect the debugger to Safety Island (Cortex-R82AE)

Configure the **SI** model connection similarly to **RSE**. Add the following **Debugger commands** to load symbols, set up source path substitution, and break at the Safety Island reset entry (`arch_exception_reset`):

```text
stop
add-symbol-file /arm-auto-solutions/build/tmp_baremetal/deploy/images/fvp-rd-aspen/si0_ramfw.elf
set substitute-path /usr/src/debug/scp-firmware/2.14.0/ /arm-auto-solutions/build/tmp_baremetal/work/fvp_rd_aspen-poky-linux/scp-firmware/2.14.0/git/
b arch_exception_reset
```

{{% notice Note %}}
Paths vary by environment. Use your actual build output and source locations when adding symbols or configuring path substitution.
{{% /notice %}}

## Start execution to release Safety Island

In **Debug Control**, select the **RSE** connection and start execution (run). The **SI** connection remains unavailable to run until Safety Island is powered up.

When RSE enables Safety Island, you will see a log message like:

```output
[INF] BL2: SI CL0 post load start
```

## Full output log

The full output log is shown here for your reference:
