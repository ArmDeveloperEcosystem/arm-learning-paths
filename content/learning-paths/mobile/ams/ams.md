[Arm Mobile Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Mobile%20Studio) is a performance analysis tool suite for developers to performance test their Android apps on Mali-based GPUs. It comprises of 4 easy-to-use tools that show you how well your game or app performs on off-the-shelf devices, so that you can identify problems that might cause slow performance, overheat the device, or drain the battery. 

| Component | Functionality |
|----------|-------------|
| [Streamline](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Streamline%20Performance%20Analyzer) | captures a performance profile that shows all the performance counter activity from the device. |
| [Performance Advisor](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Performance%20Advisor) | generates an easy-to-read performance summary from an annotated Streamline capture, and get actionable advice about where you should optimize. |
| [Graphics Analyzer](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Graphics%20Analyzer) | enables you to analyze Open GL ES and Vulkan API calls in your application, to identify rendering defects and investigate problem scenes. |
| [Mali Offline Compiler](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Mali%20Offline%20Compiler) | enables you to analyze how your shader programs would perform on a range of Mali GPUs. |
