# 1 Introduction

In this exercise, you will execute assembly code on the Nucleo-F401RE board using the debugger to examine its execution at the processor level.

This exercise is from the [Efficient Embedded Systems Education Kit](https://github.com/arm-university/Efficient-Embedded-Systems-Design-Education-Kit).

Please make sure to read and go through the Getting Started with Keil guide before/during the lab.
