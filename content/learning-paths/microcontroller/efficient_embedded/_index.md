title: "Processing Text in Mixed C/Assembly Language" 

description: In this exercise, you will execute assembly code on the Nucleo-F401RE board using the debugger to examine its execution at the processor level.

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in efficiently programming microcontrollers with C/Assembly.

learning_objectives: 
    - Write a mixed C program and assembly language subroutines for the microcontroller. 
    - Call the subroutines written in assembly in a C function.  
    - Use Arm register calling conventions when writing subroutines in assembly language.  
    - Use a suitable debugging tool to view and analyse the processor state.  

prerequisites:
    - Some familiarity with C/Assembly
    - Installed Keil MDK IDE
    - Have an STM32 Nucleo F401RE development board
