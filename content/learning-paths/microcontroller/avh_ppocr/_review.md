            Does PaddleOCR use configuration files(.yml) to control network training and evaluation parameters?
        answers:
            - "YES"
            - "NO"
        correct_answer: 1                     
        explanation: >
            PaddleOCR uses configuration files(.yml) to control network training and evaluation parameters. In the configuration file, you can set the parameters for building the model, optimizer, loss function, and model pre- and post-processing. PaddleOCR reads these parameters from the configuration file, and then forms a complete training process to complete the model training.

            Does TVM compiler compiles trained PaddlePaddle model directly?
        answers:
            - "YES"
            - "NO"
        correct_answer: 2                     
        explanation: >
            You need to export the trained PaddlePaddle model to a Paddle inference model that TVM can compile to generate code which is suitable to run on a Cortex-M processor.

        question: >
            What happens to operators by specifying --target=cmsis-nn,c ... when using TVMC to compile the model?
        answers:
            - "Operators offload to standard C library"
            - "Operators offload to CMSIS-NN library"
            - "Operators which is supported by Arm’s CMSISNN library will be offloaded to a CMSIS –NN kernel and the rest will fall back to standard C library."
        correct_answer: 3                    
        explanation: >
            By specifying --target=cmsis-nn,c, the operators supported by Arm’s CMSISNN library will be offloaded to a CMSIS –NN kernel which best makes use of underlying Arm hardware acceleration. Otherwise, it will fall back to standard C library implementations.

        question: >
            Which is the processor on the Arm Corstone-300 platform?
        answers:
            - "Cortex-M55"
            - "Cortex-M85"
            - "Cortex-M33"
        correct_answer: 1                    
        explanation: >
            Corstone-300 combines an example subsystem, complementary System IP, and software and tools to streamline SoC development. Corstone-300 leverages Cortex-M55, Arm's most AI capable Cortex-M CPU.
