## Import an Mbed OS project

Keil Studio is the successor to the Mbed Online Compiler, and allows you to develop Mbed OS 5 and 6 projects on supported Mbed Enabled boards. Keil Studio also provides limited support for Mbed 2. To get started, you can import Mbed projects from your Online Compiler workspace or mbed.com.

For more information, see the Keil Studio [documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102497/latest/Tutorials/Get-started-with-an-Mbed-OS-Blinky-example).
