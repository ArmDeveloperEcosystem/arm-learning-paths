title: "Start Debugging with µVision"
# Should start with a verb, have no adjectives (amazing, cool, etc.), and be as concise as possible.

description: >
    Learn how to use the powerful debug features of µVision.
# One sentance, is a quick summary of this learning path, viewable when searching through all learning paths. 

minutes_to_complete: 90
# Always measured in minutes. Should be an integer, to complete the learning path (not just read it).

who_is_this_for: >
    This is an advanced topic for Software developers who want to master embedded microcontroller debugging using µVision.
# One sentence that should indicate exactly who the target audience is (developers in X industries using Y tools/software for Z use-case).

learning_objectives: 
    - Use basic run/stop debugging
    - Learn sophisticated debugging using Event Recorder and Serial Wire Viewer
    - Master ETM Trace for optimum performance
    - Check your power consumption with ULINKplus
# 2-5 bullet points, one sentance each. Should start with a verb (Deploy, Measure) and indicate the value of the objective if possible.

prerequisites:
    - Some familiarity with embedded programing is assumed
    - An [Arm Account](https://developer.arm.com/register) is required
    - Installation of [Arm Keil MDK](/install-guides/mdk/) with an active MDK-Community license
    - Installation of the [Corstone-300 Ecosystem FVP](/install-guides/ecosystem_fvp/)
# List any prereqs needed before this learning path can be completed. Can include:
    # Online service accounts                                   (An Amazon Web Services account)
    # Prior knowledge                                           (Some familiarity with embedded programing)
    # Previous learning paths                                   (The Learning Path: Getting Started with Arm Virtual Hardware)
    # Particular tools/environments already being initialized   (An EC2 instance with AVH installed)
