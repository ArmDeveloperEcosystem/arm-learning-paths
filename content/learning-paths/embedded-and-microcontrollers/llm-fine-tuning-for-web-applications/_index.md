title: LLM Fine-Tuning for Web Applications

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This learning path provides an introduction for developers and data scientists new to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and looking to develop a fine-tuned LLM for web applications. Fine-tuning involves adapting a pre-trained LLM to specific tasks or domains by training it on domain-specific data and optimizing its responses for accuracy and relevance. For web applications, fine-tuning enables personalized interactions, enhanced query handling, and improved contextual understanding, making AI-driven features more effective. This session will cover key concepts, techniques, tools, and best practices, ensuring a structured approach to building a fine-tuned LLM that aligns with real-world web application requirements.

learning_objectives: 
    - Learn the basics of large language models (LLMs) and how fine-tuning enhances model performance for specific use cases.
    - Understand full fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT), and instruction-tuning.
    - Learn when to use different fine-tuning approaches based on model size, task complexity, and computational constraints.
    - Learn how to curate, clean, and preprocess domain-specific datasets for optimal fine-tuning.
    - Understand dataset formats, tokenization, and annotation techniques for improving model learning.
    - Implementing Fine-Tuning with Popular Frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch for LLM fine-tuning.

prerequisites:
    - Basic Understanding of Machine Learning & Deep Learning (Familiarity with concepts like supervised learning, neural networks, transfer learning and Understanding of model training, validation, & overfitting concepts)
    - Familiarity with Deep Learning Frameworks (Experience with PyTorch for building, training neural networks and Knowledge of Hugging Face Transformers for working with pre-trained LLMs.
