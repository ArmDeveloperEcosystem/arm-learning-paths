title: Visualize Ethos-U NPU performance with ExecuTorch on Arm FVPs

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers and data scientists who are new to TinyML and want to visualize ExecuTorch model performance on virtual Arm hardware.

learning_objectives:
  - Identify Arm-based targets suitable for TinyML workloads
  - Install and configure Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs)
  - Deploy a TinyML model using ExecuTorch on a Corstone-320 FVP
  - Visualize model execution using the FVP graphical interface

prerequisites:
    - Familiarity with basic machine learning concepts
    - A Linux or macOS computer with Python 3 installed
