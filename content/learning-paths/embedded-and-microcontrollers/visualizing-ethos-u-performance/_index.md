draft: true
cascade:
    draft: true

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers and data scientists new to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), who want to understand and visualize ExecuTorch performance on a virtual device.

learning_objectives:
    - Identify suitable Arm-based devices for TinyML applications.
    - Install Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs).
    - Deploy a TinyML ExecuTorch model to a Corstone-320 FVP.
    - Observe model execution on the FVP's graphical user interface (GUI).

prerequisites:
    - Basic knowledge of Machine Learning concepts.
    - A computer running Linux or macOS.
