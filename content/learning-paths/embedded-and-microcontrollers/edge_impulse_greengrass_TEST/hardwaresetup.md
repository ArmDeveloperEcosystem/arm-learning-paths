## Edge Device Hardware Setup

First, an edge device must be setup. In the following sections, Linux-compatible edge devices are detailed to enable them to receive and run as a AWS IoT Greengrass edge device. The list of supported devices will grow over time. 

Please select one of the following and follow the "Setup" link...

### Option 1: Ubuntu EC2 Instance [Setup](/learning-paths/embedded-and-microcontrollers/edge_impulse_greengrass/HardwareSetupEC2/)

### Option 2: Qualcomm QC6490 Platforms with Ubuntu [Setup](/learning-paths/embedded-and-microcontrollers/edge_impulse_greengrass/HardwareSetupQC6490Ubuntu/)

### Option 3: Nvidia Jetson Platforms with Jetpack 5.x/6.0 [Setup](/learning-paths/embedded-and-microcontrollers/edge_impulse_greengrass/HardwareSetupNvidiaJetson/)

### Option 4: Raspberry Pi 5 with RaspberryPi OS [Setup](/learning-paths/embedded-and-microcontrollers/edge_impulse_greengrass/HardwareSetupRPi5/)
