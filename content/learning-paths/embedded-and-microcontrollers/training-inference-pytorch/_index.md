title: "Edge AI on Arm: PyTorch and ExecuTorch rock-paper-scissors"

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for machine learning developers who want to deploy TinyML models on Arm-based edge devices using PyTorch and ExecuTorch.

learning_objectives:
  - Train a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using PyTorch
  - Use synthetic data generation for training a model when real data is limited
  - Convert and optimize a PyTorch model to an ExecuTorch program (`.pte`) for Arm-based devices
  - Run the trained model locally as an interactive mini-game to demonstrate inference

prerequisites:
  - Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
  - Familiarity with Python and the PyTorch library
  - Completion of the Learning Path [Introduction to TinyML on Arm using PyTorch and ExecuTorch](/learning-paths/embedded-and-microcontrollers/introduction-to-tinyml-on-arm/)
  - An x86 Linux host machine or VM running Ubuntu 22.04 or later
