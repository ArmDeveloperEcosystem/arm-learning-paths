minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for embedded device developers and machine learning engineers, who want need a professional-grade Arm embedded device development platform.

learning_objectives:
    - Identify suitable physical Arm-based devices for TinyML applications.
    - Configure physical embedded devices.
    - Enable hardware modules on embedded devices.
    - Deploy a apps to NXP's FRDM i.MX 93 board.
    - Using Linux on an embedded device's Arm Cortex-A processor(s).
    - Deploying machine learning models to Arm Cortex-M and Ethos-U processors will be covered in a later learning path.

prerequisites:
    - Purchase of a NXP [FRDM i.MX 93](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/frdm-i-mx-93-development-board:FRDM-IMX93) board.
    - A computer running Linux or macOS.
