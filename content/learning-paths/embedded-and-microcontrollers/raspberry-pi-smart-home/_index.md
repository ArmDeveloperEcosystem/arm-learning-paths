title: Build a Privacy-First LLM Smart Home on Raspberry Pi 5

minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for edge AI developers, Raspberry Pi hobbyists, and software engineers who want to build privacy-first smart home assistants. Youâ€™ll learn how to run large language models (LLMs) locally on the Raspberry Pi 5 using Ollama, control GPIO-connected devices, and deploy a web-based assistant without relying on cloud services.

learning_objectives:
  - Understand how the Arm architecture enables efficient, private, and responsive LLM inference
  - Run a smart home assistant on Raspberry Pi 5 with local LLM integration
  - Wire and control physical devices (for example, LEDs) using Raspberry Pi GPIO pins
  - Deploy and interact with a local language model using Ollama
  - Launch and access a web-based dashboard for device control

prerequisites:
  - An Arm-based single board computer (for example, Raspberry Pi 5 running Raspberry Pi OS)
  - Electronic components (breadboard, LEDs, resistors, jumper wires) for GPIO testing
  - Familiarity with Python programming, Raspberry Pi GPIO pinout, and basic electronics
