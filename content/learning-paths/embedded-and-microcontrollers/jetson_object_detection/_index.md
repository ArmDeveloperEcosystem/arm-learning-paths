title: Get started with object detection using a Jetson Orin Nano

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers interested in integrating object detection into their applications.

learning_objectives: 
    - Set up a Jetson Orin Nano with a MIPI CSI-2 camera for object detection
    - Detect objects from both live video and image files

prerequisites:
    - A Jetson Orin Nano (https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/jetson-orin-nano-devkit-user-guide/index.html)
    - A microSD card (64GB UHS-1 or larger is recommended)
    - A MIPI CSI-2 camera, with a 22 pin connector on at least one end
