## Converting functions

Now that your Python prototype is verified, it's time to translate the key functions into C using the CMSIS-DSP library. Because the CMSIS-DSP Python API closely mirrors the C API, the conversion is generally straightforward. In this section, you will have a look at two examples to understand how the conversion works.

### Rescaling

Here's the original Python implementation of the rescaling operation, followed by its C equivalent. Notice that the function signatures and logic remain very similar, with minor differences to account for explicit memory management and types in C.

#### Python version

```python
def rescale(self,w):
        the_max,index=dsp.arm_absmax_q15(w)

        quotient=0x7FFF
        the_shift=0
        status = -1
        if the_max != 0:
            status,quotient,the_shift = dsp.arm_divide_q15(0x7FFF,the_max)
            if status == 0:
                w=dsp.arm_scale_q15(w,quotient,the_shift)
        return(w,status,the_max)
```

#### C version

```C
#include "dsp/basic_math_functions.h"
#include "dsp/statistics_functions.h"

arm_status rescale(q15_t *w, uint32_t nb,q15_t *the_max)
{
    uint32_t index;
    q15_t quotient = 0x7FFF;
    /* Default status value for signal is zero so can't be rescaled */
    arm_status status = ARM_MATH_SINGULAR;
    int16_t the_shift = 0;
    *the_max=0;

    arm_absmax_q15(w,nb,the_max,&index);
    if (*the_max != 0)
    {
       status = arm_divide_q15(0x7FFF,*the_max,&quotient,&the_shift);
       if (status == ARM_MATH_SUCCESS)
       {
         arm_scale_q15(w,quotient,(int8_t)the_shift,w,nb);
       }
    }

    return(status);

}

```

### Signal energy

As a second example, let's have a look at another critical function: computing the signal energy. This function is essential for tasks like Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and noise suppression.

Hereâ€™s the Python version of the signal energy function, followed by its corresponding C translation. As before, while the structure of the function stays the same, explicit buffer and saturation handling is more apparent in the C version.

#### Python version

```python
def signal_energy_q15(window):
    # Calculate window
    mean=dsp.arm_mean_q15(window)
    neg_mean=dsp.arm_negate_q15([mean])[0]
    window=dsp.arm_offset_q15(window,neg_mean)

    # Energy of the window
    energy=dsp.arm_power_q15(window)
    energy=dsp.ssat(energy>>20,16)
    dB=dsp.arm_vlog_q15([energy])

    return(dB[0])
```

#### C version
```C
#include "dsp/basic_math_functions.h"
#include "dsp/fast_math_functions.h"
#include "dsp/statistics_functions.h"

int16_t signal_energy_q15(q15_t *window,uint32_t nb)
{
    q15_t mean,neg_mean;
    arm_mean_q15(window,nb,&mean);

    arm_negate_q15(&mean,&neg_mean,1);

    arm_offset_q15(window,neg_mean,window,nb);

    q63_t energy_q63;
    q15_t energy;
    arm_power_q15(window,nb,&energy_q63);

    energy=(q15_t)__SSAT((q31_t)(energy_q63>>20),16);

    // Fixed point format of result is on 16 bit
    // but the specific format has not been identified
    // to make this tutorial easier.
    // We just know it is not q15
    int16_t dB;

    arm_vlog_q15(&energy,&dB,1);

    return(dB);
}
```

As you can see, a DSP function written in Python using the CMSIS-DSP Python wrappers can be directly mapped to a very similar C function with only minor adjustments. This makes it easy to prototype quickly in Python and then migrate to efficient, production-ready C code for embedded platforms.

In the final section, you will explore some additional resources to learn more and start using CMSIS-DSP in your applications.
