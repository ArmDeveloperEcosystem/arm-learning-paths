### Corstone-300 FVP Setup for ExecuTorch

To install and set up the Corstone-300 FVP on your machine, refer to [Building and Running ExecuTorch with ARM Ethos-U Backend](https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/executorch-arm-delegate-tutorial.html). Follow this tutorial till the **"Install the TOSA reference model"** Section. It should be the last thing you do from this tutorial.


## Next Steps
1. Go to [Build a Simple PyTorch Model](/learning-paths/embedded-and-microcontrollers/introduction-to-tinyml-on-arm/build-model-8/) to test your environment setup.
