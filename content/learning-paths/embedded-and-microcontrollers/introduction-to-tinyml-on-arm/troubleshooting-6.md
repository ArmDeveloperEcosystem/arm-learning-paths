TODO can these be incorporated in the LP?


## Best Practices
- Always cross-compile your code on the host machine to ensure compatibility with the target Arm device.
- Utilize model quantization techniques to optimize performance on constrained devices like the Grove - Vision AI Module V2.
- Regularly update your development environment and tools to benefit from the latest improvements in TinyML and edge AI technologies

You've now set up your environment for TinyML development, and tested a PyTorch and ExecuTorch Neural Network.
