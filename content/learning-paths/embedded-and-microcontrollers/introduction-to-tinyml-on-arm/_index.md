    draft: true

minutes_to_complete: 40

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers and data scientists new to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) who want to explore its potential using PyTorch and ExecuTorch.

learning_objectives:
    - Describe what differentiates TinyML from other AI domains.
    - Describe the benefits of deploying AI models on Arm-based edge devices.
    - Identify suitable Arm-based devices for TinyML applications.
    - Set up and configure a TinyML development environment using ExecuTorch and Corstone-320 FVP.

prerequisites:
    - Basic knowledge of Machine Learning concepts.
    - A Linux host machine or VM running Ubuntu 22.04 or higher.
    - A [Grove Vision AI Module](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Vision-AI-Module/) or an Arm license to run the Corstone-320 Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP).
