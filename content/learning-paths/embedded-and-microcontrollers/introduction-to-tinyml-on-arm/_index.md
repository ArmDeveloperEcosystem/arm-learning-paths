minutes_to_complete: 40

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers, engineers, and data scientists who are new to TinyML and interested in exploring its potential for edge AI. You will learn how to get started using PyTorch and ExecuTorch for TinyML.

learning_objectives:
    - Identify how TinyML is different from other AI domains.
    - Understand the benefits of deploying AI models on Arm-based edge devices.
    - Select Arm-based devices for TinyML.
    - Install and configure a TinyML development environment using ExecuTorch and the Corstone-320 FVP.

prerequisites:
    - Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts.
    - A Linux host machine or VM running Ubuntu 22.04 or higher.
    - A [Grove Vision AI Module](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Vision-AI-Module/) or an Arm license to run the Corstone-300 Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP).
