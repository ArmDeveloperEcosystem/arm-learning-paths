## Before you begin 

This section requires the Grove Vision AI Module. Due to its constrained environment, we'll focus on lightweight, optimized tools and models.

### Compilers 

The examples can be built with Arm Compiler for Embedded or Arm GNU Toolchain.

Use the install guides to install each compiler on your host machine:
- [Arm Compiler for Embedded](/install-guides/armclang/)
- [Arm GNU Toolchain](/install-guides/gcc/arm-gnu/)

## Board Setup

3. In the extracted Edge Impulse firmware, locate and run the `flash_linux.sh` script to flash your device. 

   ```console
   ./flash_linux.sh
   ```
