This Learning Path is about TinyML. It serves as a starting point for learning how cutting-edge AI technologies may be used on even the smallest devices, making Edge AI more accessible and efficient. You will learn how to set up your host machine and target device to facilitate compilation and ensure smooth integration across devices.

In this section, you get an overview of the domain with real-life use-cases and available devices.

## Overview
TinyML represents a significant shift in machine learning deployment. Unlike traditional machine learning, which typically depends on cloud-based servers or high-performance hardware, TinyML is tailored to function on devices with limited resources, constrained memory, low power, and less processing capabilities. TinyML has gained popularity because it enables AI applications to operate in real-time, directly on the device, with minimal latency, enhanced privacy, and the ability to work offline. This shift opens up new possibilities for creating smarter and more efficient embedded systems.

### Benefits and applications

The advantages of TinyML match up well with the Arm architecture, which is widely used in IoT, mobile devices, and edge AI deployments.

Here are some key benefits of TinyML on Arm:


- **Power Efficiency**: TinyML models are designed to be extremely power-efficient, making them ideal for battery-operated devices like sensors, wearables, and drones.

- **Low Latency**: Because the AI processing happens on-device, there's no need to send data to the cloud, reducing latency and enabling real-time decision-making.

- **Data Privacy**: With on-device computation, sensitive data remains local, providing enhanced privacy and security. This is particularly crucial in healthcare and personal devices.

- **Cost-Effective**: Arm devices, which are cost-effective and scalable, can now handle sophisticated machine learning tasks, reducing the need for expensive hardware or cloud services.

- **Scalability**: With billions of Arm devices in the market, TinyML is well-suited for scaling across industries, enabling widespread adoption of AI at the edge.

TinyML is being deployed across multiple industries, enhancing everyday experiences and enabling groundbreaking solutions. The table below contains a few examples of TinyML applications.
