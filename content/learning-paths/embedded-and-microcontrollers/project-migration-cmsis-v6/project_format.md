## Project format conversion

The following section is only relevant to users of Keil MDK v5. It explains how to migrate from a uvprojx-based project file to the new Open-CMSIS-Pack csolution project file format.

The learning path [Convert uvprojx-based projects to csolution](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/embedded-and-microcontrollers/uvprojx-conversion/) explains how to import, convert, and build uvprojx-based projects in [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://learn.arm.com/install-guides/keilstudio_vs/). It also shows how to convert and build uvprojx-based projects on the command line.
