In this section, you will prepare the NXP [FRDM i.MX 93](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/frdm-i-mx-93-development-board:FRDM-IMX93) board for ML development.

## Unbox the NXP Board

Follow NXP's getting started instructions: [Getting Started with FRDM-IMX93](https://www.nxp.com/document/guide/getting-started-with-frdm-imx93:GS-FRDM-IMX93):
* Stop when you complete section "1.6 Connect Power Supply"

## Connect to the NXP Board

Prior to logging in to the NXP board, you need to configure `picocom`. This allows you to connect to the board using a USB cable.

1. Install the Silicon Labs driver:

2. Install [picocom](https://github.com/npat-efault/picocom):
   ```bash
   brew install picocom
   ```
{{% /notice %}}

1. Establish a USB-to-UART (serial) connection:
   - Connect the board's "DEBUG" USB-C connector to your laptop
   - Find the NXP board's USB connections in your computer's terminal:
     ```bash { output_lines = "2-7" }
     ls /dev/tty.*
     # output lines
     ...
     /dev/tty.debug-console
     /dev/tty.usbmodem56D70442811
     /dev/tty.usbmodem56D70442813
     ...
     ```

   - Connect to the NXP board:
     ```bash { output_lines = "2-5" }
     sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/tty.usbmodem56D70442811
     # output lines
     picocom v3.1
     ...
     Terminal ready
     ```
2. Log in to the NXP board:
   - Connect the board's "POWER" USB-C connector to your laptop
   - At this point you should see one red and one white light on the board
   - Next you should see scrolling text in your `picocom` window, as the NXP board boots
   - The last line should say `login:`
     ```bash { output_lines = "1-9" }
     # output lines
     ...
     [  OK  ] Reached target Graphical Interface.
              Starting Record Runlevel Change in UTMP...
     [  OK  ] Finished Record Runlevel Change in UTMP.

     NXP i.MX Release Distro 6.6-scarthgap imx93frdm ttyLP0

     imx93frdm login: 
     ```

3. [Optional] Troubleshooting:
     - Restart the NXP board, to get to the `login:` prompt:
       - Hold the NXP board's power button for 2-seconds, until the lights turn off
       - Hold the NXP board's power button again for 2-seconds, until the lights turn on

## How to Open U-Boot Terminal on the NXP Board

{{% notice macOS %}}

* Use uuu instead of U-Boot and Fastboot

{{% /notice %}}

* Connect to the NXP board, like you did above:

  ```bash { output_lines = "2-5" }
  sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/tty.usbmodem56D70442811
  # output lines
  picocom v3.1
  ...
  Terminal ready
  ```
* This time, when you log in to the NXP board, press any key to interrupt the autoboot process

  You will see the `u-boot=>` prompt, if you successfully stop autoboot:
  ```bash { output_lines = "1-2" }
  Hit any key to stop autoboot:  0 
  u-boot=>
  ```
* Now you can enter Fastboot mode by typing the following command in the `u-boot=>` prompt:
  ```bash
  fastboot 0
  ```
* You will be required to enter Fastboot mode on the next page of this learning path

## [Optional] Run the Built-In NXP Demos
* Connect the NXP board to a monitor via HDMI
* Connect a mouse to the NXP board's USB-A port
