title: Observing Ethos-U on a Physical Device, Built on Arm

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers and data scientists new to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), who want to observe ExecuTorch performance on a physical device.

learning_objectives:
    - Identify suitable physical Arm-based devices for TinyML applications.
    - Optionally, configure physical embedded devices.
    - Deploy a TinyML ExecuTorch model to NXP's FRDM i.MX 93 applicaiton processor (board).

prerequisites:
    - Purchase of a NXP [FRDM i.MX 93](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/frdm-i-mx-93-development-board:FRDM-IMX93) board.
    - A USB Mini-B to USB Type-A cable, or a USB Mini-B to USB Type-C cable.
    - Basic knowledge of Machine Learning concepts.
    - A computer running Linux or macOS.
    - VS Code
