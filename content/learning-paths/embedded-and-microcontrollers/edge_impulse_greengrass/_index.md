who_is_this_for: This learning path is for Edge AI and embedded engineers who need to scalably deploy crafted ML for the Edge to thousands of edge devices. 

learning_objectives:
  - Basic understanding of Edge Impulses Edge ML Solution
  - Basic hardware setup for Edge AI ML development with Edge Impulse
  - Install AWS IoT Greengrass onto the edge device
  - Configure the edge device with the custom integration between Edge Implulse and AWS IoT Greengrass

prerequisites:
  - An [Edge Impulse Studio](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/signup) account (workshop will walk through this).
  - An AWS Account (if not being hosted by AWS Workshop Studio)
