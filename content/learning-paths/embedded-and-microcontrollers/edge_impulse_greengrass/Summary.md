### For More Information

Below is some detailed reference information regarding the Edge Impulse AWS IoT Integration

## Model Metrics

Basic model metrics are now accumulated and published in the integration into IoT Core. The metrics will be published at specified intervals (per the "metrics\_sleeptime\_ms" component configuration parameter) to the following IoT Core topic:

		/edgeimpulse/device/<EdgeImpulseDeviceName>/model/metrics
		
The metrics published are:

* **accumulated mean**: running accumulation of the average confidences from the linux runner while running the current model
* **accumulated standard deviation**: running accumulation of the standard deviation from the linux runner while running the current model

The format of the model metrics output is as follows:

		{
		  "mean_confidence": 0.696142,
		  "standard_deviation": 0.095282,
		  "confidence_trend": "decr",
		  "details": {
		    "n": 5,
		    "sum_confidences": 3.480711,
		    "sum_confidences_squared": 2.468464
		  },
		  "ts": 1736016142920,
		  "id": "e4faa78b-2a09-40d1-adfd-8e5fc32feb11"
		}

## Command Reference

In the 2025 January integration update, the following commands are now available with the Edge Impulse Greengrass Linux Runner Greengrass integration. The following commands are dispatched via the integration's IoT Core Topic as a JSON:

		/edgeimpulse/device/<EdgeImpulseDeviceName>/command/input
		
Results from the command can be found using the following topic:

		/edgeimpulse/device/<EdgeImpulseDeviceName>/command/output

Command JSON structure is defined as follows:

	{
		"cmd": <command verb>, 
		"value": <if command is a "set" command, setting value goes here>
	}

The currently supported commands are described below:

### Initial Invocation

When the runner process is started/restarted, the following JSON will be published to the command output topic above:

		{
		  "result": {
		    "status": "started",
		    "ts": 1736026956853,
		    "id": "5c4e627e-6e9d-4382-bba7-00c0129705c4"
		  }
		}

This JSON can be used to flag a new invocation of the runner service (or a restart of the runner service). If there are any previous runtime changes made (i.e. confidence filter settings for example... see below), those changes can be resent to the newly invoked runtime. 

### Restart Command

##### Command JSON:

		{
		 "cmd": "restart"
		}
		
##### Command Description:

This command directs the integration to "restart" the Edge Impulse linux runner process. In conjunction with the "ei\_shutdown\_behavior" option being set to "wait\_for\_restart", the linux runner process will continue operating after the model has completed its operation. The linux runner process will continue to process input commands and will restart the linux runner via dispatching this command. 

### Enable Threshold Filter Command

##### Command JSON:

		{
		 "cmd": "enable_threshold_filter"
		}
		
##### Command Description:

This command directs the integration to enable the threshold filter.  The filter will control which inferences will get published into IoT Core. By default the filter is disabled so that all inferences reported are sent into IoT Core. 

##### Command Result:

The command output will be published as follows and will include the filter config:

		{
		  "result": {
		    "threshold_filter_config": {
		      "enabled": "yes",
		      "confidence_threshold": 0.7,
		      "threshold_criteria": "ge"
		    }
		  }
		}

### Disable Threshold Filter Command

##### Command JSON:

		{
		 "cmd": "disable_threshold_filter"
		}
		
##### Command Description:

This command directs the integration to disable the threshold filter.  

##### Command Result:

The command output will be published as follows and will include the filter config:

		      "enabled": "no",
		      "confidence_threshold": 0.7,
		      "threshold_criteria": "ge"
		    }
		  }
		}

### Set Threshold Filter Criteria Command

##### Command JSON:

		{

* **"eq"**: publish if inference confidence is "equal to"...
* **"le"**: publish if inference confidence is "less than or equal to"...
* **"gt"**: publish if inference confidence is "less than"...
