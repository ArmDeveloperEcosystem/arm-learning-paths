## Summary

In this Learning Path, you learned how to build and profile Linux kernel modules one step at a time. You started with an out-of-tree character driver that had a cache performance issue. Using Arm Streamline, you found where the problem was. Then, you applied the same profiling approach to an in-tree driver and saw how it works with the full kernel. While the example was simple, you can use these methods for more complex, real-world drivers and situations.

The key takeaway is that profiling isn’t just about making code faster.It’s about understanding how your code talks to the hardware. Streamline provides a clear picture of what’s happening inside the CPU so that you can write better, more efficient drivers. By learning to identify bottlenecks, you'll be more confident in fixing them and avoiding common mistakes in kernel programming.
