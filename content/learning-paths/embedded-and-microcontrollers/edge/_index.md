title: Learn how to run AI on Edge devices using Arduino Nano RP2040

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for beginners in Edge AI and TinyML, including developers, engineers, hobbyists, AI/ML enthusiasts, and researchers working with embedded AI and IoT.

learning_objectives:
  - Understand the basics of Edge AI and TinyML.
  - Collect and preprocess audio data using Edge Impulse.
  - Train and deploy an audio classification model on the Arduino Nano RP2040.
  - Control LEDs by turning them on and off based on model predictions.

prerequisites:
  - Completion of [Embedded programming with Arduino on the Raspberry Pi Pico](/learning-paths/embedded-and-microcontrollers/arduino-pico/) if you're an absolute beginner.
  - An [Edge Impulse Studio](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/signup) account.
  - The [Arduino IDE](/install-guides/arduino-pico/) with the RP2040 board support package installed on your computer.
  - An [Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect board](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-rp2040-connect-with-headers).
