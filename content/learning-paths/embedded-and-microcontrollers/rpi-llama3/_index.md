title: Run Llama 3 on a Raspberry Pi 5 using ExecuTorch

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for anyone interested in running the Llama 3 model on a Raspberry Pi 5, and learning about techniques for running large language models (LLMs) in an embedded environment.

learning_objectives:
    - Use Docker to run Raspberry Pi OS on an Arm Linux server. 
    - Compile a Large Language Model (LLM) using ExecuTorch.
    - Deploy the Llama 3 model on an edge device.
    - Describe how to run Llama 3 on a Raspberry Pi 5 using ExecuTorch.
    - Describe techniques for running large language models in an embedded environment.



prerequisites:
    - An Arm Linux machine or an [Arm cloud instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/).
    - A Raspberry Pi 5.
