minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in using PaddlePaddle for Arm Cortex-M processors.

learning_objectives: 
    - Export Paddle inference model
    - Compile Paddle inference model with TVMC
    - Deploy on the AVH Corstone-300 platform with Arm Cortex-M55

prerequisites:
    - Some familiarity with embedded programming 
    - Some familiarity with AI/ML software development 
    - An Amazon Web Services(AWS) [account](https://aws.amazon.com/) to subscribe [Arm Virtual Hardware](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-urbpq7yo5va7g) Amazon Machine Image(AMI).
