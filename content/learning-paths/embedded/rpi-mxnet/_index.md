title: Build embedded Linux applications on an Arm server

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers who want to reduce compile time for embedded Linux software projects.

learning_objectives:
    - Install a Raspberry Pi OS file system on an Arm server
    - Reduce compile time for a Linux application, the MXNet machine learning framework
    - Transfer the compiled MXNet application to a Raspberry Pi and test it
    - Utilize an Arm server to reduce compile time for your own embedded Linux projects

prerequisites:
    - An Arm computer running Linux. Cloud instances can be used, refer to the list of [Arm cloud service providers](/learning-paths/server-and-cloud/csp/)
    - A Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 board
