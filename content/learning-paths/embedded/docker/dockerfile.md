We shall prepare a docker image containing [Arm Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded) and a library of [Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs)](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Fixed%20Virtual%20Platforms), for use as a basic build and run environment.

The OS of the docker image is `Ubuntu`, though the host machine could be Windows or a different flavor of Linux.

Linux users may need to preceed the `docker` commands below with `sudo`, as the docker daemon always runs as the root user.

## Prerequisites

Download and [install](/install-tools/docker/) the appropriate Docker environment for your host platform.

## Prepare files to copy into image

Download the installation packages for Arm Compiler for Embedded and the FVP library from the [Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads).

Create a (temporary) directory, and copy the compiler and FVP library installers here. 

Note that the exact file names are dependent on the versions used - you may need to update the below `Dockerfile` as necessary.

## Create Dockerfile

A [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) is a text file containing all the instructions to build your docker image.

In the same directory, create a text file named exactly `Dockerfile` containing the [below](#dockerfile).

### Notes regarding Dockerfile

This file copies the installers to the Docker image. The exact filename(s) will depend on the versions used.

Edit the Dockerfile as necessary (`ACfE` and `FVP` arguments therein), else edit on the build command line (see later).

Whilst installing the [compiler](/install-tools/armclang/) and [FVP library](/install-tools/fvp), the EULA(s) are silently accepted. Be sure that this is satisfactory for you.

You will need to edit the licensing portion of the file to match your internal license setup. See [Arm User-Based Licenses](/install-tools/license/) for more information.

## Dockerfile {#dockerfile}
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04 as base

# Install packages: update filenames if necessary
ARG ACfE=ARMCompiler6.19_standalone_linux-x86_64.tar.gz
ARG FVP=FVP_ARM_Std_Library_11.20_15_Linux64.tgz
ARG ARCH=x86_64

ENV USER=ubuntu

RUN rm $FVP
ENV PATH "/home/$USER/FVP/bin:/home/$USER/FVP/FVP_Base:/home/$USER/FVP/FVP_MPS2:/home/$USER/FVP/FVP_VE:/home/$USER/FVP/FVP_BaseR:$PATH"

# License configuration
# Uncomment and modify below as appropriate
#
# ENV ARMLM_ONDEMAND_ACTIVATION=product_code@https://internal.ubl.server
#   or
# RUN armlm activate --code <activation-code>
#   or
# ENV ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE=port@server
```
## Build docker image
Use the command:
```console
docker build -t arm-environment .
```
to build a docker image named `arm-environment`. This name is arbitrary, and can be changed if you wish.

To change `Dockerfile` arguments from the command line, use the `--build-arg` option. For example to build an Arm-hosted docker image:
```console
docker build --build-arg ARCH=aarch64 --build-arg ACfE=ARMCompiler6.19_standalone_linux-aarch64.tar.gz --build-arg FVP=FVP_ARM_Std_Library_11.20_15_Linux64_armv8l.tgz -t arm-environment:aarch64 .
```
After a few minutes the docker image will be built and be ready for use. You can see all available images with the command:
```console
docker images
```
## Access the docker image
To interact with your docker image, enter the command:
```console
docker run -i -t arm-environment /bin/bash
```
and you will enter the terminal of the docker image. Verify everything is working correctly with, for example:
```console
armclang --version
```
Congratulations. You have a docker environment containing the Arm Compiler for Embedded and the FVP library, which you can share and replicate as needed.
