Microcontrollers built with Arm Cortex-M 32-bit processors are everywhere. They are found in products ranging from small sensors to large servers. They are used in many[Internet of things](https://www.arm.com/markets/iot) applications.

You may be looking for guidance on developing software for Arm microcontrollers or migrating applications from other architectures. 

[Arm Cortex-M processors](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu?families=cortex-m) provide a variety of performance and power alternatives. There are thousands of microcontroller devices and hundreds of boards available using Cortex-M.

Developers select Arm Cortex-M processors for a variety of reasons:
- Energy efficiency
- Ease of use
- Higher performance
- Reduced system cost
- Availability of development boards

The scale of the software developer community and the ecosystem collaborating on standards reduces risk and shortens time to market.

The Arm Cortex-M ecosystem offers a wide range of software options, including broad development tool and RTOS support.

The [Common Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS)](https://www.keil.arm.com/cmsis) is a vendor-independent abstraction layer for microcontrollers. CMSIS simplifies software reuse and reduces the learning curve for microcontroller developers.
