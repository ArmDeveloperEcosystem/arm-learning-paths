To measure the performance of MongoDB, we use the [MongoDB performance test tool](https://github.com/idealo/mongodb-performance-test).

This is an open sourced java application that tests the MongoDB performance, such as latency and throughput, by running one or more threads executing either all the same or different database operations, such as Inserts, Updates, Deletes, Counts or Finds until a defined number of operations is executed or a defined maximum runtime is reached.

## Install OpenJDK packages

Install the appropriate run-time environment to be able to use the performance test tool.

{{< tabpane code=true >}}
  {{< tab header="Ubuntu" >}}
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jre
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="RHE/Amazon" >}}
su -c "yum install -y java-1.8.0-openjdk"
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

For more information see the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/install/) website.

## Setup the MongoDB performance test tool

On your instance running MongoDB (you may need to start a new terminal), clone the `MongoDB performance test tool` project:

```bash { pre_cmd="sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jre git" }
git clone https://github.com/idealo/mongodb-performance-test.git
```

Now `cd` into project folder and execute the `jar` file

```bash { ret_code="1" }
cd mongodb-performance-test
java -jar ./latest-version/mongodb-performance-test.jar
```
This will print a description of how to use the java application


## Run Insert test

We run a test that inserts documents on `localhost:27017` (default).

Use the following options:
  * `-m` defines the test
  * `-o` defines the number of iterations
    * Alternatively, use `-d` to specify a time limit (in seconds)
  * `-t` defines the number of threads
  * `-db` defines the database to use
  * `-c` defines how the data is collected.
  
  For example:
```bash { cwd="./mongodb-performance-test" }
export jarfile=./latest-version/mongodb-performance-test.jar
java -jar $jarfile -m insert -o 1000000 -t 10 -db test -c perf
```
As the test runs, the count will be printed periodically. It will increase until it reaches 1 million and then the test will end.

## Run Update-one test

Similarly, to run this test, updating one document per query using 10, 20 and finally 30 threads for 1 hour each run (3 hours in total) run the following command:
```console
java -jar $jarfile -m update_one -d 3600 -t 10 20 30 -db test -c perf
```
For instructions on running any other tests or more details on the metrics reported, refer to the [github project for the performance tool](https://github.com/idealo/mongodb-performance-test#readme).

## View the results

During each test, statistics over the last second are printed every second in the console. Shown below is the output from the end of running Insert test

               max = 15.59 milliseconds
              mean = 1.93 milliseconds
            stddev = 0.66 milliseconds
            median = 1.87 milliseconds
              75% <= 1.99 milliseconds
              95% <= 2.22 milliseconds
              98% <= 2.64 milliseconds
              99% <= 3.85 milliseconds
            99.9% <= 15.59 milliseconds
```

The metrics are also output to the `stats-per-second-[mode].csv` which is located in the same folder as the jar file. `[mode]` is  the executed mode(s), i.e. either `INSERT`, `UPDATE_ONE`, `UPDATE_MANY`, `COUNT_ONE`, `COUNT_MANY`, `ITERATE_ONE`, `ITERATE_MANY`, `DELETE_ONE` or `DELETE_MANY`.
