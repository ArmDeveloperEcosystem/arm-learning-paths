[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) is a mature cloud computing platform. An overview of their services is described [here](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/).

As with most cloud service providers, AWS offers a pay-as-you-use [pricing policy](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/), including a number of [free](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) services.

This guide is to help you get started with [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) compute services, using Arm-based [Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) processors. This is a general purpose compute platform, essentially your own personal computer in the cloud.

Detailed instructions are available in [this tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html) from AWS.

## Create an account

Creating a personal account is straight forward. Click on [Create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/), and follow the on-screen instructions to register. See [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html) for full instructions.

If using an organization's account, you will likely need to consult with your internal administrator. See [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html) for additional information.

## Browse for an appropriate instance

AWS offers a wide range of instance types, covering all performance (and pricing) points. For an overview of the Graviton instance types, see the [Instance Type Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-explorer/), and select `AWS Graviton` from the list of `Processors`. As a general rule, instances with a `g` in their name (for example `M6g`) are Graviton based.

You then select an `instance size`, which will be one of a number of pre-defined configurations of a number of processors and available memory. If you are unsure what your compute needs are, don't worry, you can easily experiment with different configurations.

## Create your EC2 instance {#create}

The easiest way to launch your instance is via the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).

Note the `region` you have logged into (for example `US East (N.Virginia)`) in the upper right. You can select a different location from the pull-down if your default region does not offer Graviton servers.

Navigate to `EC2 dashboard`, either by searching (`Alt+S`) for `EC2`, else via `Services` > `Compute` > `EC2`.

Use the `Launch Instance` pulldown to get to the `Launch an instance` dialog.

### Name your instance {#name}

Give your instance a meaningful, but arbitrary, name. This is particularly useful when creating multiple instances in parallel.

### Select OS image

There are 1000s of [Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) available on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace), providing pre-installed or pre-configured setups.

For now, select `Ubuntu` images from the `Quick Start` list of available images, and version (e.g. `Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS`) from the pull down.

In the `Architecture` pulldown, select `64-bit (Arm)` to ensure an Arm-based instance type is used.

### Select instance type

Select an appropriate `instance type` for your compute needs from the pulldown. There is a `Compare instance types` table available if you wish to quickly compare features of different types. Scrolling down, there is an option to also `configure storage` if necessary.

### Set a Key Pair

To be able to access the instance (see later), you must use a [key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html). If this is your first time logging in, use the `Create new key pair` dialog to create your key, and save `public-key` to your local machine. Else select an appropriate existing key pair from the pull-down.

### Network settings

It is strongly recommended that you create (or use an existing) [security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html) to ensure that only users on your IP address can access your instance. Simple settings can be set here, such as selecting `My IP` from the `Allow SSH traffic from` pulldown. Other settings can be left as default.

For advanced settings, we recommend you search `security groups` and create and configure such a group in this dialog. You can then select that group when creating the instance.

### Launch instance

When all options are set, click `Launch instance` to get started. Your compute instance will be created and be available after initialization. Click the instance id to observe `Instance state` and other parameter in the `Instance summary` view. You can also access this view from the list of `Instances` on the `EC2 dashboard`.

## Connect to your instance

Once the `instance state` reports that it is `Running`, you are able to connect to the instance. You can interact with your instance via the browser (EC2 Instance Connect) or via an SSH terminal application.

### EC2 Instance Connect

In the `Instance summary` view, click `Connect`, and select the `EC2 Instance Connect` tab. Click the `Connect` button to open a terminal in the browser.

Full documentation available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-set-up.html).

### SSH client Connect

You can connect to the instance with your preferred SSH client. In the `Instance summary` view, click `Connect`, and select the `SSH client` tab to see the command line to launch the native SSH client.

For example if using `ubuntu` image:
```console
ssh -i <private_key> ubuntu@<public_ip_address>
```
Terminal applications such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/), [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and similar can be used.

Default user names for standard AMIs are listed [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connection-prereqs.html).

## Explore your instance

### uname

Use the [uname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uname) utility to verify that you are using an Arm-based server. For example:
```console
uname -m
```
will identify the host machine as `aarch64`.

### hello world

Install the `gcc` compiler. Assuming you are using `Ubuntu`, use the following, else see [here](/install-guides/gcc):
```console
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y gcc
```
Create a simple source file:
```console
nano hello.c
```
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("hello world\n");
    return 0;
}
```
Build and run the application:
```console
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
```

You are now ready to get started with the [Server and Cloud learning paths](/learning-paths/server-and-cloud/).
