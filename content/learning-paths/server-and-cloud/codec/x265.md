title: Build and Run x265 codec on Arm servers
weight: 2
---

## Prerequisites

* An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/server-and-cloud/csp/) from an appropriate cloud service provider.

This learning path has been verified on AWS EC2 and Oracle cloud services, running `Ubuntu Linux 20.04.`

## Install necessary software packages

x265 is an open-sourced H.265/HVEC encoder that offers very high compression efficiency and performance. There have been significant efforts to optimize the open-source libx265 implementation of the H.265 encoder on Arm Neoverse platforms which supports Neon instructions. The optimized code is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265_git/)

GCC for your Arm Linux distribution. Install using the steps [here](/install-tools/gcc/#native).

Install `Cmake` and other dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install git wget cmake cmake-curses-gui -y
```
Install `Build-essential` and `yasm`
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential yasm -y
```

## Download and build x265 source

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265_git.git
cd x265_git/build/linux
./make-Makefiles.bash
make
```
For detailed instructions refer to this [README](https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265_git/src/master/build/README.txt).

## Download video streams to run x265 on and measure performance

To benchmark the compression efficiency and performance of x265, you will need a set of video streams to run the codec on. In this how-to guide, we will use the video files from Google YouTube UGC dataset with different resolutions from the link [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/ugc-dataset/original_videos/Sports)

Download the `360P` and `1080P` video files:
```bash { cwd="x265_git/build/linux" }
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/ugc-dataset/original_videos/Sports/360P/Sports_360P-02c3.mkv
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/ugc-dataset/original_videos/Sports/1080P/Sports_1080P-0063.mkv
```

## Run x265 on the sample video files

To benchmark the performance of x265 over 50 frames of the `360P` video file we downloaded, run the command:
```console
./x265 --preset ultrafast --frames 50 Sports_360P-02c3.mkv --input-res 640x360 --fps 24 --output outfile.265 --frame-threads 1 --no-wpp --pools ','
```

To benchmark the performance of x265, using the `1080P` video file we downloaded, run the command:
```console
./x265 --preset ultrafast --frames 50 Sports_1080P-0063.mkv --input-res 1920x1080 --fps 24 --output outfile.265 --frame-threads 1 --no-wpp --pools ','
```
You can vary the preset settings on the different resolution images and measure the impact on performance.

For full usage instructions, refer to the command line documentation [here](https://x265.readthedocs.io/en/master/cli.html), or see the help:
```bash { cwd="x265_git/build/linux"; ret_code="1" }
./x265 --help
```

## View Results

The encoding Frame Rate (Frames per second) for the video files is output at the end of each run.

Below is an example output from running the codec on the 1080P sample video file:
