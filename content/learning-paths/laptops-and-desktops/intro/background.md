Adoption of the Arm architecture in laptops and desktops is increasing. You may be looking for guidance on developing software for Arm or how to use  an Arm based laptop or desktop for development.

Arm laptops and desktops are available with different operating systems including Windows, Linux, and ChromeOS.

Processors for laptops and desktops are created by companies such as Qualcomm, Mediatek, and Rockchip. 

You may want to adopt the same architecture on local machines as you use on servers and cloud instances. Uniform architecture makes it easier for you to build and test server, cloud, and embedded Linux applications. 

You may be interested in adding Windows on Arm support to existing Windows applications to best support consumers using Windows on Arm devices.
