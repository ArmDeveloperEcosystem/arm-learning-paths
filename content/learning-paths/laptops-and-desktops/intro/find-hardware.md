## Find Arm Hardware 

Desktops and laptops, based on the Arm architecture, are available with different operating systems including Windows, ChromeOS, and Linux.

### Windows

[Windows on Arm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/overview) laptops are available for software development from a variety of vendors. 


### ChromeOS

Chromebooks with Arm processors can also be used for software development. 

If you are looking high performance, the [Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-oled-2k-touchscreen-laptop-mediatek-kompanio-ultra-16gb-memory-256gb-ufs-seashell/6630493.p?skuId=6630493&intl=nosplash) is is powered by the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra processor, the fastest Arm chip in a Chromebook.

The Lenovo [Duet Gen 9](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-edu-chromebooks/lenovo-chromebook-duet-gen-9-11-inch-mediatek/83hh0000us) is a popular detachable Chromebook. 

### Linux

The System76 [Thelio Astra](https://www.system76.com/arm/) is a powerful Arm-based desktop computer designed by System76 and ships with Ubuntu installed. 

Both Windows and ChromeOS have a Linux subsystem which can be used for software development tasks. Read [WSL for Windows on Arm](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/wsl2) to learn more.

Some single board computers have enough performance to implement Linux based desktop computers. The [Pinebook Pro](https://pine64.org/devices/pinebook_pro/) and the [Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/) are examples.

## Cloud-based Virtual Machines

A popular alternative to using local hardware is to use a virtual machine in the cloud. Most cloud service providers offer Arm-based instances.
