## Find Arm Hardware 

Desktops and laptops, based on the Arm architecture, are available with different operating systems including Windows, ChromeOS, and Linux.

### Windows

Windows on Arm laptops are available for software development. Some examples include:

- [Lenovo ThinkPad X13s](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx/thinkpad-x13s-(13-inch-snapdragon)/len101t0019)
- [Surface Pro 9 with 5G](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-pro-9/93vkd8np4fvk)
- [Dell Inspiron 14](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/inspiron-14-laptop/spd/inspiron-14-3420-laptop)

There are many other Windows on Arm laptops available.

### ChromeOS

Chromebooks with Arm processors can also be used for software development. The Lenovo [Duet Gen 9](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-edu-chromebooks/lenovo-chromebook-duet-gen-9-11-inch-mediatek/83hh0000us) is a popular detachable Chromebook. 

### Linux

The System76 [Thelio Astra](https://www.system76.com/arm/) is a powerful Arm-based desktop computer designed by System76 and ships with Ubuntu installed. 

Both Windows and ChromeOS have a Linux subsystem which can be used for software development tasks. Read [WSL for Windows on Arm](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/wsl2) to learn more.

Some single board computers have enough performance to implement Linux based desktop computers. The [Pinebook Pro](https://pine64.org/devices/pinebook_pro/) and the [Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/) are examples.

## Cloud-based Virtual Machines

A popular alternative to using local hardware is to use a virtual machine in the cloud. Most cloud service providers offer Arm-based instances.
