## Find Arm Hardware 

Desktop and laptop hardware, based on Arm processors, is available with different operating systems including Windows, Linux, and ChromeOS. 

### Windows

[Windows Dev Kit 2023](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-dev-kit-2023/94k0p67w7581) is for software developers creating Windows applications for Arm.

Windows on Arm laptops can also be used for software development.

- [Surface Pro 9 with 5G](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-pro-9/93vkd8np4fvk)


### ChromeOS

Chromebooks with Arm processors can also be used for software development. A recent 2-in-1 with good performance is the [Acer Spin 513](https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-spin-513-cp513-2h/pdp/NX.K0LAA.001). The Lenovo [Duet 3](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-edu-chromebooks/ideapad-duet-3-chromebook-(11-inch,-qlc)/len101i0034) and [Duet 5](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-edu-chromebooks/ideapad-duet-5-chromebook/len101i0023) are popular detachable Chromebooks. 

### Linux

Both Windows and ChromeOS have a Linux subsystem which can be used for software development tasks. Read [WSL for Windows on Arm](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/wsl2) to learn more.

Some single board computers have enough performance to implement Linux based desktop computers. The [Pinebook](https://www.pine64.org/pinebook/) and [Pinebook Pro](https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/) are good examples of these. The [Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/) is powered by a [Raspberry Pi 4b](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) module.

## Cloud-based Virtual Machines

A popular alternative to using local hardware is to use a virtual machine in the cloud. Most cloud service providers offer Arm-based instances.
