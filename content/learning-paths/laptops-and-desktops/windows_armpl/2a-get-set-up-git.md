## Install Git for Windows on Arm

This section uses an example application from GitHub to demonstrate the use of Arm Performance Libraries.

If you don't already have Git installed, start by installing it using the [Git for Windows on Arm](/install-guides/git-woa/) install guide.

## Clone the Example from GitHub

The example application renders a rotating 3D cube to perform the calculations using different programming options.

First, navigate to an empty directory, and clone the repository containing the example from GitHub:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/odincodeshen/SpinTheCubeInGDI.git
```

{{% notice Note %}}
The repository containing the example is forked from the [original GitHub repository for Spin the Cube](https://github.com/marcpems/SpinTheCubeInGDI) with some modifications for demonstration purposes.
