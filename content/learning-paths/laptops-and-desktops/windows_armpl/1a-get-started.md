## Get set up with Microsoft Visual Studio  

Visual Studio 2022 is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft that empowers developers to build high-performance applications for the Arm architecture. 

You can learn more about [Microsoft Visual Studio on Arm-powered devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/visual-studio-on-arm-devices?view=vs-2022) from the Microsoft Learn website.

There are three editions of Visual Studio 2022 that are tailored to various development needs:
 - Community Edition is a free, fully-featured edition ideal for students, open source contributors, and individual developers.
 - Professional Edition offers professional developer tools, services, and subscription benefits for small teams.
 - Enterprise Edition provides the most comprehensive set of tools and services for large teams and enterprise-level development.

To establish which edition is best-suited to your needs, see [Compare Visual Studio 2022 Editions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/compare/).
