title: Run Phi-3 on Windows on Arm using ONNX Runtime

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for developers looking to build ONNX Runtime for Windows on Arm (WoA) and leverage the Generate() API to run Phi-3 inference with KleidiAI acceleration.

learning_objectives: 
    - Build ONNX Runtime and enable the Generate() API for Windows on Arm.
    - Run inference with a Phi-3 model using ONNX Runtime with KleidiAI acceleration.
prerequisites:
    - A Windows on Arm computer such as a Lenovo Thinkpad X13 running Windows 11, or a Windows on Arm [virtual machine](/learning-paths/cross-platform/woa_azure/).
