title: Run Phi-3 on a Windows on Arm machine with ONNX Runtime

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: A deep-dive for advanced developers looking to build ONNX Runtime on Windows on Arm (WoA) and leverage the Generate() API to run Phi-3 inference with KleidiAI acceleration.

learning_objectives: 
    - Build ONNX Runtime and ONNX Runtime Generate() API for Windows on Arm.
    - Run a Phi-3 model using ONNX Runtime on a Windows on Arm laptop.

prerequisites:
    - A Windows on Arm computer such as the Lenovo Thinkpad X13 running Windows 11 or a Windows on Arm [virtual machine](/learning-paths/cross-platform/woa_azure/)
