title: Optimize C++ applications on Windows on Arm using Profile-Guided Optimization

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to optimize C++ application performance on Windows on Arm using Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO).

learning_objectives: 
    - Microbenchmark a function using Google Benchmark
    - Apply profile-guided optimization to build performance-tuned binaries for Windows on Arm
    - Measure and compare performance improvements from PGO-optimized builds

prerequisites:
    - Familiarity with C++ development and compiling programs from the command line
    - A Windows on Arm machine with [Visual Studio](/install-guides/vs-woa/) and the C++ desktop development tools installed
