minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who want to learn how to port their applications to Arm64 using Arm64EC. 

learning_objectives:
    - Build a Qt-based Python desktop application
    - Create C/C++ dependencies and use them in the Qt-based Python app
    - Learn how to port the C/C++ based dependencies to Arm64 using Arm64EC

prerequisites:
    - A Windows on Arm computer such as the Lenovo Thinkpad X13s running Windows 11 or a Windows on Arm [virtual machine](/learning-paths/cross-platform/woa_azure/).
    - Any code editor. [Visual Studio Code for Arm64](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win32arm64user) is suitable.
