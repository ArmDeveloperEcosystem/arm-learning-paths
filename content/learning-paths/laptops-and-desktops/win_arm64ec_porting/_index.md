who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who want to learn how to port their applications to Arm64 using Arm64EC. 

learning_objectives:
    - Build a Qt-based Python desktop application
    - Create C/C++ dependencies and use them in the Qt-based Python app
    - Learn how to port the C/C++ based dependencies to Arm64 using Arm64EC

prerequisites:
    - A Windows on Arm computer such as [Windows Dev Kit 2023](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/dev-kit), Lenovo Thinkpad X13s running Windows 11 or Windows on Arm [virtual machine](/learning-paths/cross-platform/woa_azure/).
