cascade:
    draft: true

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who are interested in running ONNX models on Windows on Arm devices.

learning_objectives:
   - Use a pre-trained ONNX model for inference on a Windows on Arm machine.
   - Leverage native Arm64 support for Python applications running on a Windows on Arm device.

prerequisites:
    - A Windows on Arm computer such as the Lenovo Thinkpad X13s running Windows 11 or a Windows on Arm [virtual machine](/learning-paths/cross-platform/woa_azure/). 
    - Any code editor like [Visual Studio Code for Arm64](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win32arm64user).
