title: How to Use ONNX Runtime with Windows on Arm 

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who are interested in ONNX.

learning_objectives:
   - Use pre-trained ONNX model for inference
   - Leverage native Arm64 for Python applications   

prerequisites:
    - A Windows on Arm computer such as the Lenovo Thinkpad X13s running Windows 11 or a Windows on Arm [virtual machine](/learning-paths/cross-platform/woa_azure/). 
    - Any code editor, we recommend using [Visual Studio Code for Arm64](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win32arm64user).
