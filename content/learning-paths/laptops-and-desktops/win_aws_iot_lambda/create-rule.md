## Before you begin
Before you begin, prepare the weather station emulator and connect it to AWS IoT Core by completing this [Learning Path](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/win_aws_iot). Note that this Learning Path also includes the rule created in this [Learning Path](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/win_aws_iot_dynamodb).

## Create the rule
Start by creating the rule: 

1. Open AWS IoT Core, and look for *Rules* under *Message routing*:

2. Click the *Create rule* button. This will opens *Create rule* view, in which you configure the rule:

3. Use the *Create rule* view to configure the rule as follows. Firstly, under the rule name, type: check_temperature. Then, click the *Next* button. This will take you to the Configure SQL statement, where you use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT temperature FROM 'Emulators/Weather/SensorReadings'
```

This query ensures that only temperature readings will be sent to the AWS Lambda function.

4. Click the *Next* button.

5. This opens the *Attach rule actions*, where under *Action 1*, select *Lambda*. This activates additional controls (see figure below):

6. Click the *Create a Lambda function* button. This will open another tab. Select *Author from scratch*, type **SendNotification** for the function name, select *Node.js 20.x* for the runtime, and *arm64* for the architecture:

7. Scroll down, and under the Execution role select *Create a new role from AWS policy templates*. This activates additional controls, where you type **sns-email-role** for the *Role name*. Then, click the drop-down list *Policy templates*, and select *Amazon SNS publish policy*:

8. Click the **Create function** button. This will take you to the AWS Lambda Console, which looks as shown below:

9. Keep the AWS Lambda Console open in a separate tab, and go back to the *Create rule* wizard. Select *SendNotification* from the Lambda function dropdown, and ensure that the Lambda function version points to $LATEST:

10. Click the *Next* button, and then the *Create* button.

11. Go back to AWS Lambda Console, and refresh the page. You will now see that your function accepts the AWS IoT trigger:

![fig8](Figures/08.png)

This means that the AWS Lambda function you have just created has an input trigger set to AWS IoT. Specifically, the AWS Lambda function will be invoked whenever a new message is sent to the 'Emulators/Weather/SensorReadings' topic.

You are now ready to implement and test the Lambda function.
