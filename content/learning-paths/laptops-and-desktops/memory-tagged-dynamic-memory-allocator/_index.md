title: Adding Memory Tagging to a Dynamic Memory Allocator

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers who want to learn how to use the Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to protect dynamic memory allocations.

learning_objectives:
- Learn how to apply MTE to an existing memory allocator
- Understand how MTE can prevent common memory use errors

prerequisites:
- A Linux computer.
- Basic knowledge of how MTE works. Refer to the [Learn about Memory Tagging Extension Learning Path](/learning-paths/mobile-graphics-and-gaming/mte/)
- Knowledge of how a dynamic memory allocator can be implemented. Refer to [Write a Dynamic Memory Allocator Learning Path](/learning-paths/cross-platform/dynamic-memory-allocator/).
