To use desktop applications like browsers in the Ubuntu container you need to enable the connection to the ChromeOS desktop using Sommelier. 

Sommelier acts as a bridge, enabling seamless integration and smooth operation of Linux apps within the ChromeOS environment.

## Enable GUI Application Support

Install a minimal desktop environment to provide the necessary libraries for graphical applications.

```bash
sudo apt install -y xubuntu-desktop-minimal
```

Install a test application.

```bash
sudo apt install -y terminator
```

Configure the display environment variables to ensure GUI applications know where to render their windows

```console
echo 'export DISPLAY=:0' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Install the necessary tools to build Sommelier.

```bash
sudo apt install -y clang meson libwayland-dev cmake pkg-config libgbm-dev libdrm-dev libxpm-dev libpixman-1-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-composite0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libgtest-dev python3-jinja2
```

You need to build Sommelier from source code because it is not available in Ubuntu repositories. 

```bash
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2
cd platform2/vm_tools/sommelier
meson build
cd build
ninja
sudo ninja install
```

Sommelier is now installed in `/usr/local/bin/`

Create a systemd user unit file for X11 support.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
```

Use a text editor to create the file `~/.config/systemd/user/sommelier@.service` with the contents below.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Sommelier X11 bridge instance %i

[Service]
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/sommelier -X --scale=1 --no-exit-with-child -- /bin/true
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Reload the Systemd user manager and start the Sommelier service.

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now sommelier@0.service
```

Confirm the Sommelier service is running.

```bash
systemctl --user status sommelier@0.service
```

Test a graphical application works. You can pick other applications to try. 

```bash
terminator &
```

You should see a new terminal open on your ChromeOS desktop.

If needed, you can restart Sommelier.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sommelier@0
```
