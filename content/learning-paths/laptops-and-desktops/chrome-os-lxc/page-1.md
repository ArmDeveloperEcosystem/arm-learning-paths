## Overview

The [Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-oled-2k-touchscreen-laptop-mediatek-kompanio-ultra-16gb-memory-256gb-ufs-seashell/6630493.p?skuId=6630493&intl=nosplash) is powered by the Arm-based MediaTek Kompanio Ultra processor. It provides a powerful and energy-efficient platform for Linux development, with strong compatibility for containerized environments and ChromeOS Linux (Crostini). This makes it an excellent choice for coding, testing, and running modern development workflows on the go.

This Learning Path walks you through setting up an Ubuntu 24.04 container on your Arm-based Chromebook using ChromeOS's built-in Linux development environment. You'll learn how to create and manage containers, install essential development tools, and integrate your Ubuntu environment with ChromeOS features like file sharing and GUI application support. By the end, you'll have a flexible and powerful Arm Linux development environment.

## Access the ChromeOS terminal

The first step to creating an Ubuntu container on ChromeOS is to open the ChromeOS shell.

Open the Chrome browser and press **Ctrl + Alt + T** to open crosh, the ChromeOS shell.

Run the command below to start the Termina shell:

```console
vsh termina
```

You are now in the Termina environment where you can manage containers.

The `lxc` command is used to manage containers on ChromeOS. 

List the running containers:

```console
lxc list
```

If you have the default Debian container running, the output looks like:

```output
+---------+---------+-----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
|  NAME   |  STATE  |         IPV4          | IPV6 |   TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |
+---------+---------+-----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
| penguin | RUNNING | 100.115.92.204 (eth0) |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
+---------+---------+-----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
```

The name of the Debian container is `penguin`. When you enable the Linux subsystem on ChromeOS, the Debian container is created automatically, but you can create additional containers with different Linux distributions and different names.

## Create an Ubuntu 24.04 container

This command creates and starts a new Ubuntu 24.04 container named `u1`:

```bash
lxc launch ubuntu:24.04 u1
```

Expected output:

```output
Creating u1
Starting u1 
```

Check the status of the new container and confirm the status is `RUNNING`:

```bash
lxc list
```

Now there are two containers running:

```output
+---------+---------+-----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
|  NAME   |  STATE  |         IPV4          | IPV6 |   TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |
+---------+---------+-----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
| penguin | RUNNING | 100.115.92.204 (eth0) |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
+---------+---------+-----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
| u1      | RUNNING | 100.115.92.206 (eth0) |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
+---------+---------+-----------------------+------+-----------+-----------+
```

Open a shell in the Ubuntu container:

```bash
lxc exec u1 -- bash
```

## Set up Ubuntu for development

Once inside the Ubuntu container, perform initial setup tasks. 

Update package lists and upgrade installed packages:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

Install essential packages for development and system management.

You can select your favorite software packages, these are examples.
{{% /notice %}}


```bash
apt install -y net-tools gcc
```

Creating a non-root user is a crucial security best practice and ensures that applications don't have unnecessary administrative privileges. The username `ubuntu` is already available, but you can create another user.

{{% notice Note %}}
The following commands use `user1` as the username. Replace it with your own choice in subsequent steps.
{{% /notice %}}

Create a new user account (skip if you want to use the `ubuntu` user):

```bash
adduser user1
```

Add the new user to the sudo group to grant administrative privileges. Skip if you want to use the `ubuntu` user.

```bash
usermod -aG sudo user1
```

Switch to your new user account to continue the setup.

```bash
su - user1
```

If you didnâ€™t create a new user, switch to the default `ubuntu` user:

```bash
su - ubuntu
```
