   - Leverage native Arm64 for Python applications   

prerequisites:
    - A Windows on Arm computer such as [Windows Dev Kit 2023](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/dev-kit), Lenovo Thinkpad X13s running Windows 11 or Windows on Arm [virtual machine](/learning-paths/cross-platform/woa_azure/).
