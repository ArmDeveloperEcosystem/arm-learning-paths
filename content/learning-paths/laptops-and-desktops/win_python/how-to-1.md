## Python on Arm
Arm-native build tools are provided to enable the developers to create Arm64 apps using different technologies, including C/C++, .NET or even Python. More specifically, Python can be useful to rapidly prototype complex solutions that can be used for many purposes, including scientific/numerical computing, signal and image processing, training and optimizing machine learning models. As many of those tasks require extensive computations, having the Arm support enables us to boost the application performance with an optimized power consumption.

The official Python implementation and its standard library is provided by CPython. It compiles code into bytecode before interpretation, enabling it to contain platform-specific code.

Starting from Python v3.11, native support for Arm devices running Windows 11 is available. To use this feature, you just install a dedicated Arm64 Python package. There is no change to your scripts. However, as described below, there can be some build or porting requirements for the dependent pip packages, especially when you rely on the platform-specific dependencies.

In this learning path you will see how this works for the popular NumPy package on Python 3.12.

## Before you begin
Before going further, let's make sure you have installed Python v3.12 using the following installation packages: 

1. [x64](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/python-3.12.0-amd64.exe)
2. [Arm64](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/python-3.12.0-arm64.exe)

Install Python v3.12 for Arm64 and x64. The installation process is the same as described [here](/install-guides/py-woa/).

To run the Python interpreter for x64, open the command prompt and type the following command:

```console
py -3.12-64
```

The output will be similar to the following one:

```output
Python 3.12.0 (tags/v3.12.0:0fb18b0, Oct  2 2023, 13:03:39) [MSC v.1935 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Press CTRL+Z or type **exit()** to leave the interpreter.

Similarly, you can use the Python interpreter for Arm64:

```console
py -3.12-arm64
```

The above command generates the following output:

```output
Python 3.12.0 (tags/v3.12.0:0fb18b0, Oct  2 2023, 13:15:47) [MSC v.1935 64 bit (ARM64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Again, close it using the CTRL+Z or the **exit()** command.

{{% notice Note %}} By comparing the output of the two Python interpreters, we can see that both interpreters use the MSC v.1935 compiler for both x64 (labeled as AMD64) or Arm64 (labeled ARM64).{{% /notice %}}

## Python packages

Because x64 and Arm64-based Python use different underlying C compilers, the Python packages can have compatibility and porting issues. Traditionally, you install Python packages using pip, which automatically installs the dependencies. First, pip tries to find the platform-independent package (called the wheel). Then, it looks for the platform-specific package and eventually builds it from the source code.

If you are writing Python packages to take advantage of Arm64, you must ensure you compile your packages for Arm64, not x64. This is not a problem for pure (platform-independent) Python packages.

You will now see what this means in practice by installing the NumPy package using pip.

Open the command prompt and type the following command to ensure you use the latest pip version:

```console
py -3.12-arm64 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

The output will look as follows:

```output
Requirement already satisfied: pip in c:\users\db\appdata\local\programs\python\python312-arm64\lib\site-packages (23.2.1)
Collecting pip

```

Repeat the same for x64:

```console
py -3.12-64 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Now, try to install the NumPy package, which you will use later on to implement the sample application. To install NumPy, type:

```console
py -3.12-arm64 -m pip install numpy
```

The command will generate the following output:

```output

```

We can see that the installation has failed. For Arm64, there is no platform-specific wheel. So, pip downloads and tries to build the package from the source code to create the local Arm64 package wheel. However, as you do not have the build tools yet, the installation was not successful.

Before going any further, try to install NumPy for x64 by invoking the following command:

```console
py -3.12-64 -m pip install numpy
```

For x64 there is a platform-specific wheel available so the installation is successful, which is confirmed by the command output:

```output

## Arm build tools
To install the NumPy package, we will need to provide the Arm build tools. Install Visual Studio 2022 Community with the **Desktop development with C++** workload and **Arm build tools** as explained in this [installation guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102528/0100/Install-Visual-Studio). 

After installing the build tools, restart your machine and install NumPy package with the following command:

```
py -3.12-arm64 -m pip install numpy 
```

Now, the installation will be successful and you will see the following output:

```output

## Summary
You have just learned how pip can build the package from the source code and when the platform-independent package (called the wheel) is unavailable. In the next section, you will use the NumPy package to build the application.
