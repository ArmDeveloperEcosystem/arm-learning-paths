title: Use Docker Model Runner in AI Model Inference


minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This is for software developers and AI enthusiasts who want to run pre-trained AI models locally using Docker Model Runner.

learning_objectives:
    - Run AI models locally using Docker Model Runner.
    - Build containerized applications that integrate large language models (LLMs).

prerequisites:
    - Docker Desktop (version 4.40 or later) installed on a system with at least 16GB of RAM (recommended).
    - Basic understanding of Docker CLI and concepts.
    - Familiarity with Large Language Model (LLM) concepts.
