## What is OpenCV?

Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) is a popular, Open Source library that developers can use to build computer vision applications. It provides a set of tools and functions that can help you with tasks handling images and videos. 

Here are some of the benefits of using OpenCV:

* __Ease of Use__: OpenCV comes with pre-built functions for common tasks such as reading, displaying, and processing images and videos. This saves time compared to needing to cover absolutely every detail when writing an algorithm.

* __Image Processing__: You can perform operations such as changing colors, applying filters, resizing, rotating, and make other transformations to images with minimal coding effort.

* __Video Handling__: Developers can use OpenCV to capture, modify, and analyze video frames, making it ideal for creating applications such as video surveillance or video editing tools.

* __Computer Vision Algorithms__: OpenCV includes built-in algorithms for complex tasks such as:

    * Object detection; for example, face and eye recognition.
    * Edge detection.
    * Image segmentation.

* __Machine Learning__: OpenCV includes modules for training models using basic machine learning algorithms, which can be applied for pattern recognition and data analysis in visual data.

* __Community and Resources__: As OpenCV is Open Source and widely adopted, there is a large community of developers both contributing to, and supporting, OpenCV. This makes it easier to find tutorials, documentation, and answers to questions, as there are many resources available.


## Which compilers are available for Windows on Arm Development?

MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) and Clang are both compilers that are available for developers building Windows on Arm applications.

* __MSVC__: Developed by Microsoft, MSVC is a compiler that is part of the Visual Studio IDE. It is designed specifically for Windows, and integrates well with the Windows development ecosystem. MSVC is ideal for Windows-focused projects requiring seamless integration with Visual Studio.

* __Clang__: Part of the LLVM project, Clang is an Open Source compiler that is known for its modern design and cross-platform capabilities. Clang is better suited to cross-platform projects, or when using modern C++ features.
