title: Use Keras Core with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX backends

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for engineers who want to create a neural network model on Arm machines.

learning_objectives: 
    - Create a simple neural network model using Keras Core
    - Train and evaluate your neural network model with different backends
    - Generate predictions with the trained model

prerequisites:
    - Basic Machine Learning knowledge.
    - An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider, an on-premises Arm server, or a Linux virtual machine on your Arm device. 
    - Familiarity with SSH, the Linux command line, and basic system administration tasks.
