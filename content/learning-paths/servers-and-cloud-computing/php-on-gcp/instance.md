## Overview

In this section, you’ll provision a Google Cloud Axion C4A Arm virtual machine (VM) using the `c4a-standard-4` (four vCPUs, 16 GB memory) machine type in the Google Cloud Console. This process sets up a high-performance Arm server for PHP workloads, leveraging the scalability and efficiency of Axion C4A and SUSE Linux on Google Cloud.

## Provision your Google Axion C4A instance

Follow these steps to create a `c4a-standard-4` instance configured for PHP on Arm. This walkthrough covers machine selection, OS image choice, and basic networking. Ensure your Google Cloud project has billing enabled and you have permission to create Compute Engine instances.


Follow these steps to get started:

- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- In the left menu, select **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**
- Select **Create Instance**
- Under **Machine configuration**
   - Enter your **Instance name**, **Region**, and **Zone**
   - Set **Series** to `C4A`
   - Set **Machine type** to `c4a-standard-4` (four vCPUs, 16 GB memory) as shown below:

- Under **OS and Storage**, select **Change**:
   - Choose an Arm64-based OS image; for this Learning Path, select **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server**
   - Select your preferred version and ensure you choose the **Arm image** variant
   - Select **OK**
- Under **Networking**, enable **Allow HTTP traffic**
- Select **Create** to launch the instance

## What's next?

You’ve successfully provisioned an Arm-based Axion C4A VM on Google Cloud. Your server is ready for PHP installation and cloud-native development on Arm. Next, you’ll install PHP and configure your environment to run dynamic web applications on your new Arm server.
