## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## PHP

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open-source, server-side scripting language designed for web development. It allows you  to create dynamic web pages, interact with databases, handle forms, and build web applications. You can embed PHP directly into HTML, making it easy to generate content dynamically on the server before sending it to the browser.  

PHP is widely used for websites, web applications, content management systems (CMS), and APIs. For more information, see the [PHP website](https://www.php.net/) and the [PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/docs.php).
