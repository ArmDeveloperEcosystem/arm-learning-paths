## PHP

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open-source, server-side scripting language designed for web development. You can embed PHP directly into HTML, making it easy to generate content dynamically on the server before sending it to the browser. PHP is widely used for websites, web applications, content management systems (CMS), and APIs. For more information, see the [PHP website](https://www.php.net/) and the [PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/docs.php).


## Google Axion C4A

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines powered by Google's Axion CPU, built with Arm Neoverse V2 cores. They deliver high performance and energy efficiency for cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications. The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

For more information on Google Axion, see the Google blog [Introducing Google Axion Processors, our new Arm-based CPUs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu).

## What's next?

Youâ€™re now ready to begin deploying PHP workloads on Arm-based Google Cloud Axion C4A VMs. This Learning Path shows you how to optimize PHP for Arm servers, benchmark performance, and migrate from x86 to Arm with confidence.
