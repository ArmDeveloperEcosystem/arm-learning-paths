minutes_to_complete: 120

learning_objectives: 
    - Acquire and print required materials
    - Assemble and install the universal SBC rack mount system

prerequisites:
    - 3D printer
    - Hack saw / chop saw / some way to cut a threaded steel rod
    - 4U server chassis where the innards have been removed. Part used in prototype - Rosewill RSV-L4500 4U Industrial Rack-Mount Server Chassis
    - 8-32 stainless steel threaded rod at least 405 mm long. 4 x 405 mm long rods will be required per bay row. [Part used in prototype](https://www.mcmaster.com/98847A009/)
    - 8-32 stainless steel hex nut. 8 per bay row. [Part used in prototype](https://www.mcmaster.com/91841A009/)
    - 8-32 stainless steel wing nut. 8 per bay row. [Part used in prototype](https://www.mcmaster.com/92001A291/)
