who_is_this_for: This is an automated tool introductory for software developers and DevOps engineers who are preparing to migrate existing applications to Arm-based server environments. It introduces a static analysis tool (migrate-ease) that simplifies the process by identifying portability challenges early.


learning_objectives:
    - Set up an Arm development machine
    - Analyze application source code for architecture-specific dependencies
    - Understand common migration challenges and solutions
    - Use migrate-ease to identify and prioritize portability issues

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider.
