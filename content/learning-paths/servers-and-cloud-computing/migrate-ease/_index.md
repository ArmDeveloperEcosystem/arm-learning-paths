minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers looking to migrate applications to Arm-based servers using migrate-ease, a code analysis tool that scans source code repositories to identify architecture-specific porting issues before migration.


learning_objectives:
    - Identify architecture-specific dependencies in your application's source code.
    - Recognize common migration challenges and how to resolve them.
    - Use migrate-ease to detect and address AArch64 portability issues.

prerequisites:
    - Access to an [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) for testing and validation.
