title: Deploy a Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot with llama.cpp using KleidiAI on Arm servers

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers interested in running LLMs on Arm-based servers. 

learning_objectives:
    - Download and build llama.cpp on your Arm server.
    - Download a pre-quantized Llama 3.1 model from Hugging Face.
    - Run the pre-quantized model on your Arm CPU and measure the performance.

prerequisites:
    - An AWS Graviton4 r8g.16xlarge instance to test Arm performance optimizations, or any [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider or an on-premise Arm server.
