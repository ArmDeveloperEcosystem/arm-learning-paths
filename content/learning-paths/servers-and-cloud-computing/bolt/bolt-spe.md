## BOLT with SPE

The steps to optimize an executable with BOLT using Perf SPE is below.

### Collect Perf data with SPE 

Run your executable in the normal use case and collect a SPE performance profile. This will output a `perf.data` file containing the profile and will be used to optimize the executable.

Record samples while running your application. Substitute the actual name of your application for `executable`:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
perf record -e arm_spe/branch_filter=1/u -o perf.data-- ./executable
```

Perf prints the size of the `perf.data` file:

```output
[ perf record: Woken up 79 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 4.910 MB perf.data ]
```

### Convert the Profile into BOLT format

`perf2bolt` converts the profile into a BOLT data format. For the given sample data, `perf2bolt` finds all instruction pointers in the profile, maps them back to the assembly instructions, and outputs a count of how many times each assembly instruction was sampled.

If you application is named `executable`, run the commend below to convert the profile data:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
perf2bolt -p perf.data -o perf.fdata -nl ./executable
```

Below is example output from `perf2bolt`, it has read all samples and created the file `perf.fdata`.

```output

PERF2BOLT: out of range samples recorded in unknown regions: 5 (6.3%)
PERF2BOLT: wrote 14 objects and 0 memory objects to perf.fdata
```

### Run BOLT to generate the optimized executable

The final step is to generate a new executable using `perf.fdata`.

To run BOLT use the command below and substitute the name of your application:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
llvm-bolt ./executable -o ./new_executable -data perf.fdata -reorder-blocks=ext-tsp -reorder-functions=hfsort -split-functions -split-all-cold -split-eh -dyno-stats
```

The output from `llvm-bolt` describes the executable stats before and after optimization:

```output
