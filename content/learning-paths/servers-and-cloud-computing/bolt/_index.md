title: Learn how to optimize an application with BOLT

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to learn how to use BOLT on an Arm executable.

learning_objectives: 
    - Build an application which is ready to be optimized by BOLT 
    - Profile an application and collect performance information
    - Run BOLT to create an optimized executable 

prerequisites:
    - An Arm based system running Linux with [BOLT](/install-guides/bolt/) and [Linux Perf](/install-guides/perf/) installed. The Linux kernel should be version 5.15 or later. Earlier kernel versions can be used, but some Linux Perf features may be limited or not available. 
    - (Optional) A second, more powerful Linux system to build the software executable and run BOLT.
