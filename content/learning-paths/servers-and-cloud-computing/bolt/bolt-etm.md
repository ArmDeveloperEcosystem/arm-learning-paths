## BOLT with ETM

The steps to optimize an executable with BOLT using Perf ETM are below.

### Collect Perf data with ETM 

Run your executable in the normal use case and collect an ETM performance profile. This will output a `perf.data` file containing the profile and will be used to optimize the executable.

Record ETM while running your application. Substitute the actual name of your application for `executable`:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
perf record -e cs_etm//u -o perf.data -- ./executable
```

Perf prints the size of the `perf.data` file:

```output
[ perf record: Woken up 10 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 1.254 MB perf.data ]
```

### Convert the Profile into BOLT format

`perf2bolt` converts the profile into a BOLT data format. For the given sample data, `perf2bolt` finds all branch events in the profile, maps them back to the assembly instructions, and outputs a count of how many times each assembly branch was sampled.

If you application is named `executable`, run the command below to convert the profile data:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
perf2bolt -p perf.data -o perf.fdata --itrace=l64i1us ./executable
```

Below is example output from `perf2bolt`, it has read all samples and created the file `perf.fdata`.

```output

PERF2BOLT: wrote 401 objects and 0 memory objects to perf.fdata
```

### Run BOLT to generate the optimized executable

The final step is to generate a new executable using the `perf.fdata`.

To run BOLT use the command below and substitute the name of your application:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
llvm-bolt ./executable -o ./new_executable -data perf.fdata -reorder-blocks=ext-tsp -reorder-functions=hfsort -split-functions -split-all-cold -split-eh -dyno-stats
```

The output from `llvm-bolt` describes the executable stats before and after optimization:

```output

### Using ETM AutoFDO

ETM AutoFDO is a Linux perf record method similar to ETM that performs trace strobing to collect small slices of trace. This reduces the amount of data recorded per second and that allows it to be run for longer periods compared to ETM and creates much smaller files. 

Record with AutoFDO while running your application. Substitute the actual name of your application for `executable`:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
perf record -e cs_etm/autofdo/u -o perf.data -- ./executable
```

Perf prints the size of the `perf.data` file:

```output
[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.021 MB perf.data ]
```

The output shows that much less data was written to `perf.data` for the same executable

The BOLT steps are the same as ETM case shown above.

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
perf2bolt -p perf.data -o perf.fdata --itrace=l64i1us ./executable
llvm-bolt ./executable -o ./new_executable -data perf.fdata -reorder-blocks=ext-tsp -reorder-functions=hfsort -split-functions -split-all-cold -split-eh -dyno-stats
```

The optimized executable is now available as `new_executable`.
