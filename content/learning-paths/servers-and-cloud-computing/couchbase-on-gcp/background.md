## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Google’s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## Couchbase

Couchbase is an open-source NoSQL distributed database designed for building high-performance, scalable, and flexible modern applications. Developed by Couchbase, Inc. It combines the capabilities of a key-value store, document database, and distributed caching system in a single unified platform.

Couchbase provides a memory-first architecture for low-latency data access, along with a powerful query engine (N1QL) that supports SQL-like syntax for JSON data. It also features built-in replication, automatic sharding, and cross-datacenter synchronization (XDCR), enabling seamless scalability and high availability across clusters and regions.

It supports both on-premises and cloud deployments (including AWS, Azure, and GCP) and integrates with modern application stacks and container platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.

Known for its high throughput, low latency, and ease of scaling, Couchbase is ideal for use cases such as real-time analytics, session management, content delivery, IoT, and mobile synchronization through Couchbase Mobile.
