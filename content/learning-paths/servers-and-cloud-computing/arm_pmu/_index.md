title: How to use the Arm Performance Monitoring Unit and System Counter

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers who want to instrument hardware event counters or the system counter in software applications.

learning_objectives:
    - Understand different options for accessing counters from user space
    - Use the system counter to measure time in code
    - Use PAPI to instrument event counters in code
    - Use the Linux perf_event_open system call to instrument event counters in code
prerequisites:
    - An Arm computer running Linux. A bare metal or cloud metal instance is best because they expose more counters. You can use a virtual machine (VM), but fewer counters may be available.
