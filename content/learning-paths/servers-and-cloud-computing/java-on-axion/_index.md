title: Run Java applications on Google Axion processors

minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to learn how to run their Java-based applications on Arm-based Google Axion processors in Google Cloud. Most Java applications will run on Axion with no changes needed, but there are optimizations that can help improve application performance on Axion.

learning_objectives: 
    - Create an Arm-based VM instance with Google Axion CPU
    - Deploy a Java application on Axion
    - Understand Arm performance for different JDK versions
    - Test common performance optimization flags

prerequisites:
    - A [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account with access to Axion based instances (C4A).
