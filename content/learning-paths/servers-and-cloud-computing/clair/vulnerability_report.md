You can submit a container image to Clair and get a vulnerability report.

## Before you begin

Clair should be running as a combined deployment or as a distributed deployment.

## Submitting a manifest

You can submit a manifest for a container image to your running Clair deployment using `clairctl`, the CLI program for Clair. 

{{% notice Note %}}
Wait at least 5-10 minutes before submitting manifest via `clairctl` to allow time for Clair to gather the vulnerabilities in the postgresql database. If you don't wait until Clair is ready, `clairctl` will deliver a clean vulnerability report.
{{% /notice %}}

1. Build the Clair CLI

You should be in the top level Clair directory.

Generate `clairctl` binary:

```console
go build ./cmd/clairctl
```

2. Submit the manifest to Clair using the CLI:

You can use a container from another Learning Path, [Learn how to use Docker](/learning-paths/cross-platform/docker/) as a test for Clair. 

The last argument to `clairctrl` is the name of the container. 

To check `armswdev/uname` run:

```console
./clairctl --config "./local-dev/clair/config.yaml" -D report armswdev/uname
```

3. Review the vulnerability report

For the image `armswdev/uname` the output from the report is:
