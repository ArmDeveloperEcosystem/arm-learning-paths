minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for software developers who want to learn how Trustee services can be used to run an end-to-end attestation flow with Arm's Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA).

learning_objectives:
     - Describe how you can use attestation with Arm's Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) and Trustee services.
     - Deploy a simple workload in a CCA realm on an Armv9-A AEM Base Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) that has support for RME extensions.
     - Connect the workload with Trustee services to create an end-to-end example that uses attestation to unlock the confidential processing of data.

prerequisites:
    - An AArch64 or x86_64 computer running Linux or MacOS. You can use cloud instances, see this list of [Arm cloud service providers](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/).
    - Completion of the [Get Started with CCA Attestation and Veraison](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/cca-veraison) Learning Path.
    - Completion of the [Run an end-to-end Attestation Flow with Arm CCA](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/cca-essentials/) Learning Path.
