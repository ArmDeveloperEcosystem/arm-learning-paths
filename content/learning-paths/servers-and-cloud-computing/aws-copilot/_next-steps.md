    For developers interested in deepening their knowledge of container orchestration on AWS, exploring Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a logical next step. EKS offers a more robust environment for managing complex containerized applications, supporting multi-architecture setups including Graviton processors. This knowledge will be beneficial in scaling and managing larger, more complex containerized systems.
