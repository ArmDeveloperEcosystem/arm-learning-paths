title: Microbenchmark and tune network performance with iPerf3 and Linux traffic control

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for performance engineers, Linux system administrators, and application developers who want to microbenchmark, simulate, or tune the networking performance of distributed systems.

learning_objectives: 
    - Run accurate network microbenchmark tests using iPerf3.
    - Simulate real-world network conditions using Linux Traffic Control (tc).
    - Tune basic Linux kernel parameters to improve network performance.

prerequisites:
    - Basic understanding of networking principles such as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
    - Access to two [Arm-based cloud instances](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/).
