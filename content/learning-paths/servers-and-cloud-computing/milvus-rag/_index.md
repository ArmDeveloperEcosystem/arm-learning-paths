minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application on Arm servers.

learning_objectives: 
    - Create a simple RAG application using Zilliz Cloud.
    - Launch an LLM service on Arm servers.

prerequisites:
    - A basic understanding of a RAG pipeline.
    - An AWS Graviton3 C7g.2xlarge instance, or any [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp) from a cloud service provider or an on-premise Arm server.
    - A [Zilliz account](https://zilliz.com/cloud), which you can sign up for with a free trial.
