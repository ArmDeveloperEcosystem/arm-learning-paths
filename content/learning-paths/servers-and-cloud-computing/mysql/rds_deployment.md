## Deploy MySQL using Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

RDS is a Relational database service provided by AWS. To deploy a MySQL RDS instance, Create a `main.tf` Terraform file.
To generate and configure the Access key ID and Secret access key, follow the instructions mentioned in the [AWS Credentials install guide](/install-guides/aws_access_keys/).

Here is the complete `main.tf` file:

```console
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "Testing_Mysql" {
  identifier           = "mysqldatabase"
  allocated_storage    = 10
  db_name              = "mydb"
  engine               = "mysql"
  engine_version       = "8.0.28"
  instance_class       = "db.t3.micro"
  parameter_group_name = "default.mysql8.0"
  skip_final_snapshot  = true
  username             = var.username
  password             = var.password
  availability_zone    = "us-east-2a"
  publicly_accessible  = true
  deletion_protection  = false

  tags = {
    name = "TEST MYSQL"
  }
}
``` 

To find the correct instance type for RDS, check the [list](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/instance-types/) of supported instance types. Select a Graviton (Arm) based instance type.

Create a `credential.tf` file, for passing your secret keys and password. Here is the file content:

```console
variable "username" {
  default = "admin"
}

variable "password" {
  default = "Arm4test" #we_can_choose_any_password, except special_characters.
}
```

Now, use the below Terraform commands to deploy the `main.tf` file.

## Terraform commands

Same instructions as on the [previous page](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/mysql/ec2_deployment#terraform-commands).

### Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### Create a Terraform execution plan (optional)

```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply a Terraform execution plan

```bash
terraform apply
```

### Verify the RDS setup

To verify the setup on AWS console. Go to **RDS » Databases**, you should see the instance running.

## Connect to RDS using EC2 instance

To access the RDS instance, make sure that your instance is correctly associated with a security group and VPC. To access RDS outside the VPC, Follow this [document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_CommonTasks.Connect.html).

To connect to the RDS instance, you need the `Endpoint` of the RDS instance. To find the Endpoint, Go to **RDS » Dashboard » {{YOUR_RDS_INSTANCE}}**.

![Screenshot (280)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92315883/209741254-55b40b52-1c56-482a-ab48-e33f510a1cf6.png)


Now, connect to RDS with the MySQL Client installed locally using the above Endpoint. Use the `username` and `password` mentioned in the `credential.tf` file.

```bash { output_lines="2-15"}
mysql -h {{Endpoint}} -u admin -pArm4test
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

### Create Database and Table
Use the below command to list, create and use database.

```console { output_lines="2-11" }
show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mydb               |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.10 sec)
```

```console { output_lines="2" }
create database arm_test;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.11 sec)
```

```console { output_lines="2-12" }
show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| arm_test           |
| information_schema |
| mydb               |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
6 rows in set (0.10 sec)
```

```console { output_lines="2" }
use arm_test;
Database changed
```

To create and access a table, follow this [document](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/mysql/ec2_deployment#access-database-and-create-table).

More information about [Creating and connecting to a MySQL DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.MySQL.html) is available from AWS.

### Clean up resources

Run `terraform destroy` to delete all resources created.

```console
terraform destroy
```
