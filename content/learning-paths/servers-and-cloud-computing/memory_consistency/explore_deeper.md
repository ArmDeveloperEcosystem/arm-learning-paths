## Exploring the Memory Model Further

This Learning Path took you through a practical approach to exploring the Arm memory model and thread synchronization. 

If you would like to explore this topic further and more formally, read through these posts from the Arm Architectures and Processors Blog:

- [A working example of how to use the herd7 Memory Model Tool](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/how-to-use-the-memory-model-tool).
- [How to generate litmus tests automatically with the diy7 tool](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/generate-litmus-tests-automatically-diy7-tool).
- [Running litmus tests on hardware using litmus7](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/running-litmus-tests-on-hardware-litmus7).
- [Expanding the Memory Model Tools to System-level architecture](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/expanding-memory-model-tools-system-level-architecture).

The [diy7 documentation](https://diy.inria.fr/doc/index.html) also provides links to papers that explore memory models more formally.

## Documentation on Barriers

- [Barriers on Armv8](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100941/0101/Barriers).
- [Load-Acquire and Store-Release on Armv8](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102336/0100/Load-Acquire-and-Store-Release-instructions).
- [Barrier Litmus Tests and Cookbook](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/genc007826/latest). This was written in 2009, but is still relevant.

## More Tests to Explore

There are many more tests that can be explored in the [herd7 simulator tool](https://developer.arm.com/herd7).
