## Herd7 and Litmus7 Test Primer

This section gives you an overview of the syntax of litmus tests and how to run them. More comprehensive information on developing and running litmus tests can be found in the [diy7 documentation](https://diy.inria.fr/doc/index.html).

For this Learning Path, you use an abbreviated version of the `MP.litmus` test included in the [herd7 online simulator](https://developer.arm.com/herd7).

Open a file editor of your choice, and copy the contents below into a file called `test.litmus`:

```
AArch64 MP
{
0:X1=x; 0:X3=y;
1:X1=y; 1:X3=x;
}
  P0               |  P1               ;
  MOV    W0,  #1   |  LDR    W0,  [X1] ;
  STR    W0,  [X1] |  LDR    W2,  [X3] ;
  MOV    W2,  #1   |                   ;
  STR    W2,  [X3] |                   ;
exists
(1:X0=1 /\ 1:X2=0)
```
Now inspect this litmus file to gain a better understanding of the assembly code:

#### Architecture and Test Code

- The first line sets the target architecture of this test, which is `AArch64`. This is required because the diy7 tool supports architectures other than Arm. After the architecture label is `MP` which is a label that gives this test its name. `MP` stands for "Message Passing".
  - In short, the first line states: "This is a test for AArch64 called `MP`".

#### Thread Definitions

- This test defines two threads `P0` and `P1`. It is possible to define more threads than just two, but in this Learning Path you work with only two threads to avoid increasing complexity.

#### Initial State Setup

- The lines between the brackets ( `{..}` ) determine the initial state of the CPU registers for this test.
  - `0:X1=x; 0:X3=y;` defines the initial state for `P0`.
    - Register X1 holds memory address `x`.
    - Register X3 holds memory address `y`.
  - `1:X1=y; 1:X3=x;` defines the initial state for `P1`.
    - Register X1 holds memory address `y`.
    - Register X3 holds memory address `x`.
  - Any registers and memory addresses not listed in between these brackets are initialized to 0.
  - The memory address `x` contains the message to pass, while the memory address `y` is the message ready flag.
#### Assembly Code for Threads

- Below the brackets you see the assembly snippets for `P0` and `P1`.
  - `P0`:
    - The first `MOV` and `STR` writes a `1` into memory address `x` (the payload).
    - The second `MOV` and `STR` writes a `1` into memory address `y` (the flag).
  - `P1`:
    - The first `LDR` reads the address `y` (the flag). The value of the flag is stored in register `W0`:
    - The second `LDR` reads the address `x` (the payload). The value of the payload is stored in register `W2`.
    - Notice that you are not looping on the flag in the same way as would normally be done in a message passing scenario. You will explore loops in the next section.
#### Test Condition

- The last two lines show a test condition. This test condition asks the question:
  - "On `P1`, is it possible to observe register `W0` (the flag) set to 1 **AND** register `W2` (the payload) set to 0?"
    - Wait...but the condition uses register names `X0` and `X2`, not `W0` and `W2`. See the note below for more.
  - In this condition check syntax, `/\` is a logical **AND**, while `\/` is a logical **OR**.
#### Note on `X` and `W` Registers:
  - Notice you are using `X` registers for storing addresses and for doing the condition check, but `W` registers for everything else.
    - Addresses need to be stored as 64-bit values, hence the need to use `X` registers for the addresses because they are 64-bit. `W` registers are 32-bit. In fact, register `Wn` is the lower 32-bits of register `Xn`.
    - Writing the litmus tests this way is simpler than using all `X` registers. If all `X` registers are used, the data type of each register needs to be declared on additional lines. For this reason, most tests are written as shown above. The way this is done may be changed in the future to reduce potential confusion around the mixed use of `W` and `X` registers, but all of this is functionally correct.

Before you run this test with `herd7` and `litmus7`, you can hypothesize on what might be observed in registers `X0` (flag) and `X2` (payload) on thread `P1`. Even though Arm machines are not Sequentially Consistent (modern machines usually aren't), start by assuming this to be the case anyway. To reason on the execution of these threads in a Sequentially Consistent way, means to imagine the instructions on `P0` and `P1` are executed in some interleaved order. 

Further, if you interleave these instructions in all possible permutations, you can figure out all of the possible valid outcomes of registers `X0` (flag) and `X2` (payload) on `P1`. For the example test above, the possible valid outcomes of `(X0,X2)` (or `(flag,data)`) are `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, & `(1,1)`. Some permutations that result in these valid outcomes are shown below. These are not all the possible instruction permutations for this test. Listing them all would make this section needlessly long.

#### A Permutation That Results in `(0,0)`:

```output
(P1)  LDR  W0,  [X1]  # P1 reads flag, gets 0
(P1)  LDR  W2,  [X3]  # P1 reads payload, gets 0
(P0)  MOV  W0,  #1
(P0)  STR  W0,  [X1]  # P0 writes payload, sets 1
(P0)  MOV  W2,  #1
(P0)  STR  W2,  [X3]  # P0 writes flag, sets 1
```
In this permutation of the test execution, `P1` runs to completion before `P0` even starts its execution. For this reason, `P1` observes the initial values of 0 for both the flag and payload.

#### A Permutation That Results in `(0,1)`:

```output
(P1)  LDR  W0,  [X1]  # P1 reads flag, gets 0
(P0)  MOV  W0,  #1
(P0)  STR  W0,  [X1]  # P2 writes payload, sets 1
(P1)  LDR  W2,  [X3]  # P1 reads payload, gets 1
(P0)  MOV  W2,  #1
(P0)  STR  W2,  [X3]  # P2 writes flag, sets 1
```
In this permutation of the test execution, `P1` reads the initial value of the flag (the first line) because this instruction is executed before `P0` writes the flag (the last list). However `P1` reads the payload value of 1 because it executes after `P0` writes the payload to 1 (third and forth lines).

#### A Permutation that Results in `(1,1)`:

```output
(P0)  MOV  W0,  #1
(P0)  STR  W0,  [X1]  # P2 writes payload, sets 1
(P0)  MOV  W2,  #1
(P0)  STR  W2,  [X3]  # P2 writes flag, sets 1
(P1)  LDR  W0,  [X1]  # P1 reads flag, gets 1
(P1)  LDR  W2,  [X3]  # P1 reads payload, gets 1
```
In this permutation of the test execution, `P2` runs to completion before `P1` starts. Thus `P1` observes both the flag and payload set to 1.

Result `(1,0)` is not possible in a Sequentially Consistent execution of this test. This is because the instructions in `P0` and `P1` must execute in program order (a requirement for Sequential Consistency). It is only possible to get the result `(1,0)` if the machine is not Sequentially Consistent. Not being Sequentially Consistent means that the memory access instructions (`STR` and `LDR`) can be executed out of program order if there are no dependencies between them.

Now that you have looked at a hypothesis on what you should see assuming a Sequentially Consistent machine, try running the test with `herd7`. `herd7` simulates all the possible instruction permutations to see which outcomes are possible. 

Run the following command:

```bash
herd7 ./test.litmus
```

The output of the test on `herd7` should look like:

```output
Test MP Allowed
States 4
1:X0=0; 1:X2=0;
1:X0=0; 1:X2=1;
1:X0=1; 1:X2=0;
1:X0=1; 1:X2=1;
Ok
Witnesses
Positive: 1 Negative: 3
```
Outcome `(1,0)` is observed when testing against the Arm memory model, as indicated by the positive witness on the test condition. This result demonstrates that the Arm memory model violates Sequential Consistency. 

The Arm memory model tends to be considered a Relaxed Consistency model, which means that it is possible for an Arm CPU in the real world to use ordering rules that are stronger than Relaxed Consistency. Going stronger on the memory model will not violate the Arm ordering rules. A stronger memory model means that there might be less opportunity for hardware-based optimizations, it will not affect the correctness of code execution - assuming there are no bugs in the code. You can think of all Arm Neoverse CPUs as following a Relaxed Consistency model, which means that acquire-release ordering is supported.

In a Release Consistency model, ordinary memory accesses like `STR` and `LDR` do not need to follow program order. This relaxation in the ordering rules expands the list of instruction permutations in the litmus test above. It is these additional instruction permutations allowed by the Relaxed Consistency model that yield at least one permutation that results in `(1,0)`. Below is one such example of a permutation. For this permutation, the `LDR` instructions in `P1` are reordered.

#### One Possible Permutation Resulting in `(1,0)`:

```output
(P1)  LDR  W2,  [X3]  # P1 reads payload, gets 0
(P0)  MOV  W0,  #1
(P0)  STR  W0,  [X1]  # P2 writes payload, sets 1
(P0)  MOV  W2,  #1
(P0)  STR  W2,  [X3]  # P2 writes flag, sets 1
(P1)  LDR  W0,  [X1]  # P1 reads flag, gets 1
```
There are more possible permutations of instructions, including some that reorder the `STR` instructions in `P0`. You will not explore those here, this is what `herd7` tests for.

Now that you see the results against the formal Arm memory model, you can test on actual hardware with `litmus7`. Because `litmus7` runs the test against actual hardware, it can't guarantee that all instruction permutations are tested. This is because there isn't a way to manipulate the CPU's dynamic instruction scheduler - this is "hardwired" in the CPU design. 

Instead, you have to run numerous iterations of the test to increase the probability that you see all possible outcomes. Thus, `litmus7` can't formally verify the CPU's memory model; it can only provide empirical evidence to support a claim on the CPU's memory model. It can however be used to disprove that the CPU does not follow a specific memory model. For example, you can prove that Arm is not Sequentially Consistent by finding at least one outcome that would not be allowed by Sequential Consistency.

You will now run the same `test.litmus` file 1,000,000 times with `litmus7`. One million is the default number of iterations, but this can be adjusted with the `-s` switch. It is also possible to run the test on more than one CPU in parallel with the `-a` switch. The more test iterations you run, the more confidence you can have that all possible outcomes have been captured. 

Run the following command on your Arm Neoverse CPU-based instance:
 
```bash
litmus7 ./test.litmus
```

The output from running the test should look like:

```output
Test MP Allowed
Histogram (4 states)
553396:>1:X0=0; 1:X2=0;
53040 *>1:X0=1; 1:X2=0;
96641 :>1:X0=0; 1:X2=1;
296923:>1:X0=1; 1:X2=1;
```
`litmus7` reports the same four outcomes observed in the `herd7` simulation. The outcome marked with the asterisk indicates the positive witness of the condition check, and the tool also reports the number of times each outcome was observed. This result suggests that this CPU is consistent with the formal memory model (as tested with `herd7`), at least for this test. 

To build further confidence, additional tests and more test iterations with `litmus7` are needed. The [herd7 online simulator](https://developer.arm.com/herd7) contains additional tests that can be executed, and you can create additional tests.

Now you can move on to exploring thread synchronization in the next section.
