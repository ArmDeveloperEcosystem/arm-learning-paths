title: Explore Thread Synchronization in the Arm memory model

minutes_to_complete: 150

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for developers seeking practical ways to test thread synchronization approaches in the Arm memory model.

learning_objectives:
    - Test thread synchronization assembly snippets against the formal definition of the Arm memory model.
    - Test thread synchronization assembly snippets on Arm hardware.
    - Compare the results of different thread synchronization approaches. 

prerequisites:
    - An understanding of memory consistency models (such as Sequential Consistency, Weak Ordering, Relaxed Consistency, and Processor Consistency).
    - An understanding of thread synchronization.
    - Familiarity with Arm assembly language, and the ability to find relevant information on Arm assembly instructions.
    - Familiarity with general-purpose registers.
    - Familiarity with memory barriers, including Acquire-Release Semantics.
