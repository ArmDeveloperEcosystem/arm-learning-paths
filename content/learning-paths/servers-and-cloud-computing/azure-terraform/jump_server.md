## Introduction to Jump Server

A Jump Server (also known as a bastion host) is an intermediary device responsible for funneling traffic through firewalls using a supervised secure channel. By creating a barrier between networks, jump servers create an added layer of security against outsiders wanting to maliciously access sensitive company data. Only those with the right credentials can log into a jump server and obtain authorization to proceed to a different security zone.

{{% notice Note %}}
An alternative to setting up a Jump server like below is to use [Azure Bastion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview).

## Deploying Arm VMs on Azure and providing access via Jump Server

For deploying Arm VMs on Azure and providing access via Jump Server, the Terraform configuration can be broken down into four files: `providers.tf`, `main.tf`, `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf`.

Once configured, it creates an instance with OS Login configured to use as a bastion host and a private instance to use alongside the bastion host.

Start by creating these files in your desired directory.

```console
touch providers.tf main.tf variables.tf outputs.tf
```

### Providers

Tell Terraform which cloud provider to connect to, Azure for this example.

Using a file editor of your choice, add the code below to a file named `providers.tf`:

```console
terraform {
  required_version = ">=0.12"

  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~>2.0"
    }

    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~>3.0"
    }

    tls = {
      source  = "hashicorp/tls"
      version = "~>4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
``` 

### Create required resources

Add the code shown below in a file named `main.tf` to create the required resources and VM:

```console
# Create a resource group if it doesnâ€™t exist.

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "resource_group" {
  name     = "${var.resource_prefix}-rg"
  location = var.location
}

# Create virtual network with public and private subnets.

  name                = "${var.resource_prefix}-vnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]

### Variables

To define the variables required to create a virtual machine, add the code below in a file named `variables.tf`: 

```console
# Define prefix for consistent resource naming.

variable "resource_prefix" {
  default     = "bastion-test"
  description = "Service prefix to use for naming of resources."
}

# Define Azure region for resource placement.

variable "location" {
  default     = "eastus2"
  description = "Azure region for deployment of resources."
}

# Define username for use on the hosts.

variable "username" {
  default     = "ubuntu"
  description = "Username to build and use on the VM hosts."
}
```

### Outputs

Add the code below in `outputs.tf` to get the Private IP addresses name and Public IP address of the Bastion VM:

```console
# IP address of public IP addresses provisioned for bastion VM.

output "public_ip_address" {
  description = "IP address of public IP addresses provisioned for bastion VM."
  value       = azurerm_linux_virtual_machine.bastion_vm.public_ip_address
}

# IP addresses of private IP addresses provisioned.

output "private_ip_addresses" {
  description = "IP addresses of private IP addresses provisioned."
  value       = concat(azurerm_network_interface.bastion_nic.*.private_ip_address, azurerm_network_interface.target_nic.*.private_ip_address)
}
```

## Terraform commands

### Initialize Terraform

Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform deployment. This command downloads the Azure modules required to manage your Azure resources. 

```console
terraform init
```

The output should be similar to:

```output
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

### Create a Terraform execution plan

Run `terraform plan` to create and preview an execution plan before applying it to your cloud infrastructure.

```console
terraform plan -out main.tfplan
```

A long output of resources to be created will be printed. The bottom of the output should be similar to:

```output
Plan: 15 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + private_ip_addresses = [
      + (known after apply),
      + (known after apply),
    ]
  + public_ip_address  = (known after apply)

â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€

Saved the plan to: main.tfplan
```

{{% notice Note %}}
The **terraform plan** command is optional. You can directly run the **terraform apply** command, but it is always better to confirm the resources that will be created.
{{% /notice %}}

### Apply a Terraform execution plan

Run `terraform apply` to apply the execution plan to your cloud infrastructure. The command below creates all required infrastructure.

```console
terraform apply main.tfplan
```

If prompted to confirm if you want to create Azure resources, answer `yes`.

The bottom of the output should be similar to:

```output
Apply complete! Resources: 15 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

private_ip_addresses = [
  "10.0.1.4",
  "10.0.2.4",
]
public_ip_address = "20.242.22.182"
```

Make note of the outputs to identify your instances. This is particularly useful when having multiple instances.

### Verify the Instance and Bastion Host setup

In the Azure Portal, go to the [Virtual Machines page](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines) to verify your instances setup. You should see the following two instances running:

  1. An instance named **bastion-test-bstn-vm001** with the **Public** and **Private IP addresses** matching your `public_ip_address` output and an address from the `private_ip_addresses` output.
  2. An instance named **bastion-test-trgt-vm001** with the **Public IPv4 address** matching an address from the `private_ip_addresses` output.

Click on the Instance **Name**s to display more details about your instances, including the Private IP Address.

### Use Jump Host to access the Private Instance

Connect to a target server via a Jump Host using the `-J` flag from the command line. This tells SSH to make a connection to the jump host and then establish a TCP forwarding to the target server from there:

```console
  ssh -J ubuntu@<bastion-vm-public-IP> ubuntu@<target-vm-private-IP>
```

{{% notice Note %}}
Replace `<bastion-vm-public-IP>` with the public IP of the bastion VM and `<target-vm-private-IP>` with the private IP of the target VM.
{{% /notice %}}

Terminal applications such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/), [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and similar can be used.

The output is shown below. Once connected, you are now ready to use your instance.

```output
ubuntu@ip-172-31-38-39:~/azure_jumpserver$ ssh -J ubuntu@20.242.22.182 ubuntu@l0.0.2.4

### Clean up resources
Run `terraform destroy` to delete all resources created through Terraform, including resource groups, virtual networks, and all other resources.

```console
terraform destroy
```

A long output of resources to destroy will be printed. If prompted to confirm if you want to destroy all resources, answer `yes`.

The bottom of the output should be similar to:

```output

```

## Explore your instance

### Run uname

Use the [uname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uname) utility to verify that you are using an Arm-based server. For example:

```console
uname -m
```
will identify the host machine as `aarch64`.

### Run hello world

Install the `gcc` compiler. If you are using `Ubuntu`, use the following commands. If not, refer to the [GNU compiler install guide](/install-guides/gcc):

```console
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y gcc
```

Using a text editor of your choice, create a file named `hello.c` with the contents below:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("hello world\n");
    return 0;
}
```
Build and run the application:

```console
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
```

The output is shown below:

```output
hello world
```
