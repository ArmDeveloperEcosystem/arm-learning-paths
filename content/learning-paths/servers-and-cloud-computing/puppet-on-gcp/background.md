## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Google’s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## Puppet

[Puppet](https://puppet.com/) is an **open-source configuration management and automation tool** designed to help system administrators and DevOps teams **manage infrastructure as code**. Developed by [Puppet Labs](https://puppet.com/company/), it automates the provisioning, configuration, and management of servers and services across large-scale environments.

Puppet uses a **declarative language** to define system configurations, ensuring that every machine’s state matches the desired setup described in its manifests. It supports both **agent-based** and **agentless** architectures, making it flexible for diverse deployment needs.

Known for its **scalability**, **reliability**, and **idempotent behavior**, Puppet continuously enforces configurations, reducing manual effort and configuration drift. It integrates well with major platforms like **Linux**, **Windows**, **macOS**, and cloud providers such as **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**.

Common use cases include **automating server configuration**, **applying security policies**, **software installation**, and **infrastructure auditing**. Puppet is widely used in enterprises for managing **hybrid and multi-cloud environments** efficiently.
