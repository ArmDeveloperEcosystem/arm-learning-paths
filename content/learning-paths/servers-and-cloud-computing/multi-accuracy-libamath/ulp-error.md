# ULP Error and Accuracy

In the development of Libamath, a metric called ULP error is used to assess the accuracy of functions.
This metric measures the distance between two numbers, a reference (`want`) and an approximation (`got`), relative to how many floating-point “steps” (ULPs) these two numbers are apart.

It can be calculated by:

```
ulp_err = | want - got | / ULP(want)
```

Because this is a relative measure in terms of floating-point spacing (ULPs)—that is, this metric is scale-aware—it is ideal for comparing accuracy across magnitudes. Otherwise, error measures would be very biased by the uneven distribution of the floats.


# ULP Error Implementation

In practice, however, the above expression may take different forms to account for sources of error that may occur during the computation of the error itself.

In the implementation used here, this quantity is held by a term called `tail`:

```
ulp_err = | (got - want) / ULP(want) - tail |
```

This term takes into account the error introduced by casting `want` from a higher precision to working precision. This contribution is given in terms of ULP distance:

```
tail = | (want_l - want) / ULP(want) |
```

Here is a simplified version of the ULP Error. Use the same `ulp.h` from the previous section.

Use a text editor to opy the code below into a new file `ulp_error.h`.

```C
// Defines ulpscale(x)
#include "ulp.h"

// Compute ULP error given:
// - got: computed result -> got (float)
// - want_l: high-precision reference -> want (double)
double ulp_error(float got, double want_l) {

    float want = (float) want_l;

    // Early exit for exact match
    if (want_l == (double)want && got == want) {
       return 0.0;
    }

    int ulp_exp = ulpscale(want);

    // Fractional tail from float rounding
    double tail = scalbn(want_l - (double)want, -ulp_exp);

    // Difference between computed and rounded reference
    double diff = (double)got - (double)want;

    // Return total ULP error with bias correction
    return fabs(scalbn(diff, -ulp_exp) - tail);
}
```
Note that the final scaling is done with respect to the rounded reference.

In this implementation, it is possible to get exactly 0.0 ULP error if and only if:

* The high-precision reference (`want_l`, a double) is exactly representable as a float, and
* The computed result (`got`) is bitwise equal to that float representation.

Below is a small example to check this implementation.

Save the code below into a file named `ulp_error.c`.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include "ulp_error.h"

int main() {
    float got = 1.0000001f;
    double want_l = 1.0;
    double ulp = ulp_error(got, want_l);
    printf("ULP error: %f\n", ulp);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile the program with GCC.

```bash
gcc -O2 ulp_error.c -o ulp_error
```

Run the program:

```bash
./ulp_error
```

The output should be:

```
ULP error: 1.0
```

If you are interested in diving into the full implementation of the ulp error, you can consult the [tester](https://github.com/ARM-software/optimized-routines/tree/master/math/test) tool in [AOR](https://github.com/ARM-software/optimized-routines/tree/master), with particular focus to the [ulp.h](https://github.com/ARM-software/optimized-routines/blob/master/math/test/ulp.h) file. Note this tool also handles special cases and considers the effect of different rounding modes in the ULP error.
