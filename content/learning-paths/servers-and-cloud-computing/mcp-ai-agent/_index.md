title: Deploy an MCP server on a Raspberry Pi 5 and interact with it using the AI agent

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path targets LLM and IoT developers who already know their way around Large Language Model (LLM) concepts and networking. It walks you through deploying a lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server on a Raspberry Pi 5 and shows you how to interact with it via the OpenAI-Agent SDK.

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand how to Deploy a lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server on Raspberry Pi 5
    - Design and register custom tools for the AI Agent
    - Create custom endpoints
    - Learn uv — a fast, efficient Python package manager

prerequisites:
    - Rapberry Pi
    - Basic understanding of Python and prompt engineering.
    - Understanding of LLM and AI Agent fundamentals
