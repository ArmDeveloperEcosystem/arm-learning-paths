## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## Apache Spark for big data processing on Arm

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for fast and general-purpose big data processing. 

It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R, and supports in-memory computation for increased performance. 

Spark is widely used for large-scale data analytics, machine learning, and real-time data processing. Learn more from the [Apache Spark official website](https://spark.apache.org/) and its [detailed official documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/).
