            Which of the following is NOT a way to improve your cluster's Arm compatibility?
        answers:
            - Upgrade images to a newer version that supports arm64.
            - Find an alternative image that supports arm64.
            - Request that the developers of an image build and publish an arm64 version.
            - Contact the Kubernetes community to upgrade your cluster.
        correct_answer: 4

            KubeArchInspect helps you identify the available images that support arm64, but it does not upgrade the cluster. You would have to upgrade the cluster manually using the appropriate Kubernetes commands.
