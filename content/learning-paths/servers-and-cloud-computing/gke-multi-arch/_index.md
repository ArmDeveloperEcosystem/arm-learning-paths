minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers who are looking to migrate their existing x86 containerized applications to Arm

learning_objectives: 
    - Add Arm-based nodes to an existing x86-based GKE cluster
    - Rebuild an x86-based application to make it multi-arch and run on Arm
    - Learn how to add taints and tolerations to GKE clusters to schedule application pods on architecture specific nodes
    - Run a multi-arch application across multiple architectures on a single GKE cluster

prerequisites:
    - A [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Create an account if needed.
    - A computer with [Google Cloud CLI](/install-guides/gcloud) and [kubectl](/install-guides/kubectl/)installed.
