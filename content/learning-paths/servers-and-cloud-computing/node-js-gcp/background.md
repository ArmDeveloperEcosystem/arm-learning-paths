## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines powered by Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, built on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. These instances deliver high performance and energy efficiency for modern cloud workloads, including CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

For more information on Google Axion, see the Google blog [Introducing Google Axion Processors, our new Arm-based CPUs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu).

## Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine. It enables you to build scalable server-side applications, APIs, and backend services using JavaScript. Node.js features an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it highly efficient for handling concurrent connections. Node.js is widely used for web servers, real-time applications, microservices, and cloud-native backend services. 

For more information on Node.js, see the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en) and the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/).
