## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine.

It allows developers to build scalable server-side applications, APIs, and backend services using JavaScript. Node.js features an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it highly efficient for handling concurrent connections.

Node.js is widely used for web servers, real-time applications, microservices, and cloud-native backend services. Learn more from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en) and its [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/).
