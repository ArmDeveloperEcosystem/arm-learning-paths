## Validate Node.js installation with a baseline test

Confirm that your Node.js installation works as expected before benchmarking performance on your Arm-based VM. Run these baseline tests to verify that Node.js is installed correctly and can execute JavaScript code and serve HTTP requests. Catch setup issues early and ensure your environment is ready for further testing.

## Run a simple REPL test

Start the Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) to run JavaScript commands interactively:

```console
node
```

Type the following command inside the REPL:

```console
console.log("Hello from Node.js");
```

The output is similar to:

```output
Hello from Node.js
undefined
```

This confirms that Node.js can execute JavaScript commands successfully. Press "Ctrl-D" to exit node.

## Test a basic HTTP server

Create a file named `app.js` with the following code to validate that Node.js can handle web requests:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Baseline test successful!\n');
});

server.listen(80, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://0.0.0.0:80/');
});
```

The server listens for incoming connections on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. By binding to the IP address 0.0.0.0, the server accepts connections from any network interface, not just from localhost. This configuration enables access from other devices on the network.

Run the HTTP server in the background using sudo:

```console
export MY_NODE=`which node`
sudo ${MY_NODE} app.js &
```

The expected output is:

```output
Server running at http://0.0.0.0:80/
```

## Test locally with curl

Run the following command to test the server locally:

```console
curl http://localhost:80
```

The expected output is:

```output
Baseline test successful!
```

## Test from a browser

Print your VMâ€™s public URL and open it in a browser:

```console
echo "http://$(curl -s ifconfig.me):80/"
```

You should see the following message in your browser, confirming that your Node.js HTTP server is running successfully:

![Screenshot showing the browser displaying 'Baseline test successful!' from the Node.js HTTP server running on a Google Axion C4A Arm VM. alt-text#center](images/node-browser.png "Browser displaying baseline test successful dialogue message")

You have now validated that Node.js is working correctly on your Arm VM. Proceed to benchmarking and performance testing.
