## Overview

In this Learning Path, you'll run quantized Phi models with ONNX Runtime on Microsoft Azure Cobalt 100 servers. 

Specifically, you'll deploy the Phi-3.5 vision model on Arm-based servers running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

You will learn how to build and configure ONNX Runtime to enable efficient LLM inference on Arm CPUs.

This Learning Path walks you through the following tasks:
- Build ONNX Runtime.
- Quantize and convert the Phi-3.5 vision model to ONNX format.
- Run the model using a Python script with ONNX Runtime for CPU-based LLM inference.
- Analyze performance on Arm CPUs.

## Install dependencies

On your Arm-based server, install the following packages:

```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv cmake -y
```

## Create a requirements file

Use a file editor of your choice and create a `requirements.txt` file with the Python packages shown below:

```python
    requests
    torch
    transformers
    accelerate
    huggingface-hub
```

## Install Python dependencies

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
    python3 -m venv onnx-env
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
    source onnx-env/bin/activate
```

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Clone and build ONNX Runtime

Clone and build the `onnxruntime-genai` repository, which includes the Kleidi AI optimized ONNX Runtime, using the following commands:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai.git
    cd onnxruntime-genai/
    python3 build.py --config Release
    cd build/Linux/Release/wheel/
    pip install onnxruntime_genai-0.9.0.dev0-cp312-cp312-linux_aarch64.whl
```
{{% notice Note %}}
Ensure you're using Python 3.12 to match the cp312 wheel format.

This build includes optimizations from KleidiAI for efficient inference on Arm CPUs.

## Download and quantize the model

Navigate to your home directory. Now download the quantized model using `huggingface-cli`:
```bash
    cd ~
    huggingface-cli download microsoft/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct-onnx --include cpu_and_mobile/cpu-int4-rtn-block-32-acc-level-4/* --local-dir .
```

The Phi-3.5 vision model is now downloaded in ONNX format with INT4 quantization and is ready to run with ONNX Runtime.
