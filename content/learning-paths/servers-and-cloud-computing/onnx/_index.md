title: Run Phi-3.5 Vision Model with ONNX Runtime on Microsoft Azure Cobalt 100 VMs

draft: true
cascade:
    draft: true

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers, ML engineers, and cloud practitioners looking to deploy Microsoft's Phi Models on Arm-based servers using ONNX Runtime.

learning_objectives:
    - Install ONNX Runtime, download and quantize the Phi-3.5 vision model.
    - Run the Phi-3.5 model with ONNX Runtime on Azure.
    - Analyze performance on Arm Neoverse-N2 based Azure Cobalt 100 VMs.

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from an appropriate cloud service provider. This Learning Path has been tested on a Microsoft Azure Cobalt 100 virtual machine with 32 cores, 8GB of RAM, and 32GB of disk space.
    - Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts.
    - Familiarity with ONNX Runtime and Azure cloud services.
    - Knowledge of LLM (Large Language Model) fundamentals.
