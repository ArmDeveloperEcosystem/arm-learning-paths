title: Deploy Phi-4-mini model with ONNX Runtime on Azure Cobalt 100

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for developers, ML engineers, and cloud practitioners looking to deploy Microsoft's Phi Models on Arm-based servers using ONNX Runtime.

learning_objectives:
    - Quantize and run the Phi-4-mini model with ONNX Runtime on Azure.
    - Analyze performance on Arm Neoverse N2 based Azure Cobalt 100 VMs.

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from an appropriate cloud service provider. This Learning Path has been tested on an Azure Cobalt 100 virtual machine.
    - Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts.
    - Familiarity with ONNX Runtime and Azure cloud services.
    - Knowledge of Large Language Model (LLM) fundamentals.
