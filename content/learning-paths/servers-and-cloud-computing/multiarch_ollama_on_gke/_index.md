minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This topic explains how developers can migrate a homogeneous amd64 K8s cluster to a hybrid (arm64 and amd64) cluster using a multi-architecture container image on GKE. Ollama is the application used to demonstrate the migration. 


learning_objectives:
  - Spin up a GKE cluster with amd64 and arm64 nodes.
  - Apply Ollama amd64-based and arm64-based deployments and services using the same container image.
  - Ping, pull models, and make inferences to experience the performance of each architecture.

prerequisites:
    - A [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - A local computer with the [Google Cloud CLI](/install-guides/gcloud) and [kubectl](/install-guides/kubectl/) installed.
    - The [GKE Cloud Plugin](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#gcloud).
