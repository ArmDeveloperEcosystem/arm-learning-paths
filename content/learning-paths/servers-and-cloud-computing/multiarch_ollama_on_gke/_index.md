title: Add Arm nodes to your GKE cluster using a multi-architecture Ollama container image 

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for developers who want to compare the performance of amd64 and arm64 deployments by running inferences on a hybrid GKE cluster using an Ollama multi-architecture container image.


learning_objectives:
  - Create a hybrid GKE cluster with amd64 and arm64 nodes.
  - Deploy Ollama services for amd64 and arm64 architectures using a single multi-architecture container image.
  - Validate deployments by pinging, pulling models, and running inferences to compare architecture performance.

prerequisites:
    - A [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - A local machine with [Google Cloud CLI](/install-guides/gcloud/) and [kubectl](/install-guides/kubectl/) installed.
    - The [GKE Cloud Plugin](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#gcloud) installed.
