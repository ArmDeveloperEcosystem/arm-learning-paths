## Get started

You can install Arm Performance Libraries on an Arm-based AWS instance, such as `t4g.2xlarge`, running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. 

For instructions to create and connect to an AWS instance, see [Get started with Servers and Cloud Computing](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/intro/). 

Once connected via `ssh`, install the required packages with the following commands: 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc g++ make -y
```

Next, install Arm Performance Libraries with the commands below. For more information, see the [Arm Performance Libraries install guide](/install-guides/armpl/). 

```bash
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/cdn-downloads/permalink/Arm-Performance-Libraries/Version_24.10/arm-performance-libraries_24.10_deb_gcc.tar
tar xvf arm-performance-libraries_24.10_deb_gcc.tar
sudo ./arm-performance-libraries_24.10_deb/arm-performance-libraries_24.10_deb.sh --accept
```

Install environment modules to set the required environment variables. This allows you to quickly build the example applications. 

```bash
sudo apt install environment-modules
source /usr/share/modules/init/bash
export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH:/opt/arm/modulefiles
module avail
```

You should see the `armpl/24.10.0_gcc` available. 

```output
------------------------------------ /opt/arm/modulefiles ---------------------------------------
armpl/24.10.0_gcc  
```

Load the module with the following command: 

```bash
module load armpl/24.10.0_gcc
```

Navigate to the `lp64` C source code examples and compile: 

```bash
cd $ARMPL_DIR/examples_lp64
# -E is to preserve environment variables
sudo -E make c_examples 
```

Your terminal output shows the examples being compiled and the output ends with: 

```output
...
Test passed OK
```
