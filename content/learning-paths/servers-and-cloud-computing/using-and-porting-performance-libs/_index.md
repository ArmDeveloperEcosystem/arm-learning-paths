title: Migrate applications that leverage performance libraries 

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for both C and C++ developers who want to migrate applications that rely on optimized performance libraries from x86 to Arm Architecture.

learning_objectives: 
    - Describe the differences between standard and performance libraries.
    - Incorporate optimized libraries. 
    - Port a basic application from x86 to AArch64. 
prerequisites:
    - Access to both an Arm and an x86-based cloud instance.
    - Intermediate understanding of C++, compilers, and Linux.
