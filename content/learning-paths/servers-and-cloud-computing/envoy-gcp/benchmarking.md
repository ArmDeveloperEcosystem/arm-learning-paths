## How to run Envoy benchmarks with Siege on Arm64 in GCP

Siege is a lightweight HTTP load testing and benchmarking tool that simulates concurrent users making requests to a target service. It is useful for Envoy benchmarking because it measures availability, throughput, response time, and failure rates under load, thus helping evaluate Envoyâ€™s performance as a proxy under real-world traffic conditions.

Follow the steps outlined to run Envoy benchmarks using Siege.

## Install Siege (build from source)


Install required build tools:

```console
sudo dnf groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
sudo dnf install -y wget make gcc
```
Download, extract and build Siege source:

```console
wget http://download.joedog.org/siege/siege-4.1.6.tar.gz
tar -xvzf siege-4.1.6.tar.gz
cd siege-4.1.6
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
You have now successfully built and installed Siege on your Arm-based machine.

Verify installation:

```console
siege --version
```
This checks if Siege is installed properly and shows the version number:
```output
SIEGE 4.1.6

## Envoy benchmarking


To start, make sure Envoy is up and running with your config file (listening on port 10000):


```console
envoy -c envoy_config.yaml --base-id 1
```
This runs the Envoy proxy with your configuration file (envoy_config.yaml) so it can start listening for requests.

On another terminal, verify that Envoy is running as expected with curl:


```
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:10000/get
```
Running from another terminal returns a **200 OK** status, confirming that Envoy is running and successfully processing requests.

## Run a time-based load test

There are different ways you can set up your benchmark tests. Here, you will run a benchmark for a fixed time instead of using a request count:


```console
siege -c30 -t10S http://127.0.0.1:10000/get
```
This runs a load test where 30 users hit Envoy continuously for 10 seconds. After this, Siege will show performance results.

The output should show a list of HTTP requests and responses followed by a summary as shown:

```output
HTTP/1.1 200     0.03 secs:     383 bytes ==> GET  /get
HTTP/1.1 200     0.03 secs:     383 bytes ==> GET  /get
HTTP/1.1 200     0.03 secs:     383 bytes ==> GET  /get
HTTP/1.1 200     0.02 secs:     383 bytes ==> GET  /get
HTTP/1.1 200     0.42 secs:     383 bytes ==> GET  /get
HTTP/1.1 200     0.03 secs:     383 bytes ==> GET  /get
HTTP/1.1 200     0.03 secs:     383 bytes ==> GET  /get
HTTP/1.1 200     1.17 secs:     383 bytes ==> GET  /get
HTTP/1.1 200     0.81 secs:     383 bytes ==> GET  /get
HTTP/1.1 200     0.14 secs:     383 bytes ==> GET  /get

## Understanding Envoy benchmark metrics and results with Siege

- **Transactions**: Total number of completed requests during the benchmark.
- **Availability**: Percentage of requests that returned a successful response.
- **Elapsed Time**: Total time taken to run the benchmark test.
- **Data Transferred**: Total amount of data exchanged during the test.
- **Response Time**: Average time taken for the server to respond to each request.
- **Transaction Rate**: Number of requests processed per second.
- **Throughput**: Volume of data transferred per second.
- **Concurrency**: Average number of simultaneous connections maintained.
- **Successful Transactions**: Total number of requests completed successfully.
- **Failed Transactions**: Total number of requests that failed.
- **Longest Transaction**: Maximum response time observed for a single request.
- **Shortest Transaction**: Minimum response time observed for a single request.

## Benchmark summary on x86_64

### Envoy performance benchmarking comparison on Arm64 and x86_64
When you compare the benchmarking performance results between the two instance types with the same vCPUs, you will notice that on the Google Axion C4A Arm-based instances:

- You have more successful transactions, fewer failures
- Lower response times, higher transaction rate, better throughput

You have successfully learned how to use Siege to benchmark Envoy on your Arm-based Axion Google cloud instance, validating both performance and reliability against similar x86_64 instances.
