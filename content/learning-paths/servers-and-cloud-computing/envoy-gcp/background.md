## Google Axion C4A instances on Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines powered by Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is built on Arm Neoverse V2 cores. Designed for high performance and energy efficiency, these VMs are well-suited to modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series can provide a cost-efficient alternative to x86 VMs while leveraging the scalability and performance characteristics of the Arm64 (AArch64) architecture on Google Cloud.

To learn more about Google Axion, see the blog [Introducing Google Axion Processors, our new Arm-based CPUs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu).

## Envoy Proxy for service proxying and traffic management on Arm

Envoy Proxy is an open-source, high-performance edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. It handles service-to-service communication, traffic routing, load balancing, and observability - improving the reliability and security of microservices.

Envoy is widely used in service meshes, API gateways, and modern cloud environments. Learn more on the [Envoy website](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) and in the [Envoy documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/).
