## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Google’s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## Envoy for service proxying and traffic management on Arm

Envoy is an open-source, high-performance edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications.

It handles service-to-service communication, traffic routing, load balancing, and observability, making microservices more reliable and secure.

Envoy is widely used in service meshes, API gateways, and modern cloud environments. Learn more from the [Envoy official website](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) and its [official documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/).
