minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This introductory topic is for developers who want to measure and compare the performance of Go applications on Arm-based servers.

learning_objectives:
    - Provision Arm64 and x86_64 VM instances on Google Cloud 
    - Install Go, Sweet, and Benchstat on each VM instance
    - Run benchmarks and use Benchstat to compare Go application performance across architectures

prerequisites:
    - A [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/). This Learning Path can be run on any cloud provider or on-premises, but it focuses on Google Cloudâ€™s Axion Arm64-based instances.
    - A local machine with [Google Cloud CLI](/install-guides/gcloud/) installed
