title: Analyze cache behavior with Perf C2C on Arm

minutes_to_complete: 15

who_is_this_for: This topic is for performance-oriented developers working on Arm-based cloud or server systems who want to optimize memory access patterns and investigate cache inefficiencies using Perf C2C and Arm SPE.

learning_objectives: 
    - Identify and fix false sharing issues using Perf C2C, a cache line analysis tool.
    - Enable and use the Arm Statistical Profiling Extension (SPE) on Linux systems.
    - Investigate cache line performance with Perf C2C.

prerequisites:
    - Access to an Arm-based cloud instance with support for the Arm Statistical Profiling Extension (SPE).
    - A basic understanding of cache coherency and its impact on performance.
    - Familiarity with Linux Perf tools.
