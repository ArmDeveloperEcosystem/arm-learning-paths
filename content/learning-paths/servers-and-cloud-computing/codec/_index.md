title: Run x265 (H.265 codec) on Arm servers

minutes_to_complete: 10

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to
  build and run an x265 codec on Arm servers and measure performance.


learning_objectives:
- Build x265 codec on Arm server
- Run x265 codec on Arm server with the same video of various resolutions and encoding
  presets to measure the performance impact

prerequisites:
- An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from an appropriate
  cloud service provider. This Learning Path has been verified on AWS EC2 and Oracle cloud services, running `Ubuntu Linux 20.04.`
