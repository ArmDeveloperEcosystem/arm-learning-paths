## Install necessary software packages

`x265` is an open-source H.265/HVEC encoder that offers very high compression efficiency and performance. There have been significant efforts to optimize the open-source libx265 implementation of the H.265 encoder on Arm Neoverse platforms which supports Neon instructions. The optimized code is available on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265_git/)

Install GCC for your Arm Linux distribution. Refer to the [install guide](/install-guides/gcc/native/) for additional information.

Install `Cmake` and other dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget git-all cmake cmake-curses-gui build-essential -y
```
If you are running on x86, also install `yasm`
```console
sudo apt install  yasm -y
```

## Download and build x265 source

Clone the repository and navigate to the `linux` directory.

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265_git.git
cd x265_git/build/linux
```

Run the interactive bash script to change the default flags for the build. Then, run `make`.

```console
./make-Makefiles.bash
make
```

{{ % notice Note % }}
If you encounter an error regarding an unknown value, you can change the `ENABLE_NEON_I8MM` flag to `OFF` using the interactive bash script in the previous step.

```output
error: unknown value ‘armv9-a+i8mm+sve2’ for ‘-march’
```
{{ % /notice % }}

For detailed instructions refer to this [README](https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265_git/src/master/build/README.txt).

## Download video streams to run x265 on and measure performance

To benchmark the compression efficiency and performance of `x265`, you will need a set of video streams to run the codec on. You can use the video files from the [Google YouTube UGC data set](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/ugc-dataset/original_videos/Sports) with different resolutions.

Download the `360P` and `1080P` video files:
```bash { cwd="x265_git/build/linux" }
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/ugc-dataset/original_videos/Sports/360P/Sports_360P-02c3.mkv
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/ugc-dataset/original_videos/Sports/1080P/Sports_1080P-0640.mkv
```

## Run x265 on the sample video files

To benchmark the performance of `x265` over 50 frames of the `360P` video file, run the command:
```console
./x265 --preset ultrafast --frames 50 Sports_360P-02c3.mkv --input-res 640x360 --fps 24 --output outfile.265 --frame-threads 1 --no-wpp --pools ','
```

To benchmark the performance of `x265`, using the `1080P` video file, run the command:
```console
./x265 --preset ultrafast --frames 50 Sports_1080P-0640.mkv --input-res 1920x1080 --fps 24 --output outfile.265 --frame-threads 1 --no-wpp --pools ','
```
You can vary the preset settings on the different resolution images and measure the impact on performance.

For full usage instructions, refer to the [command line documentation](https://x265.readthedocs.io/en/master/cli.html), or see the help:
```console
./x265 --help
```

## View Results

The encoding Frame Rate (Frames per second) for the video files is output at the end of each run.

Shown below is example output from running the codec on the 1080P sample video file:
