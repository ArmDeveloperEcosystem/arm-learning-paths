## Example of a Race Condition when porting from x86 to AArch64

Due to the differences in the hardware perceived ordering as explained in the earlier sections, source code written for x86 may behave differently when ported to Arm. To demonstrate this we will create a trivial example and run it both on an x86 and Arm cloud instance. 

Start an Arm-based cloud instance, in this example I am using `t4g.xlarge` AWS instance running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. If you are new to using cloud-based virtual machines, please see our [getting started guide](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/intro/). 

First confirm you are using a Arm-based instance with the following command.

```bash
uname -m
```
You should see the following output.

```output
aarch64
```

Next, we will install the prerequisitve packages. 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++ clang
```

Copy and paste the following code snippet into a file named `relaxed_memory_model.cpp`. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
#include <cassert>
#include <chrono>

struct Node {
    int x;
};
std::atomic<Node*> node{nullptr};

void threadA() {
    auto n = new Node();
    n->x = 42;
    node.store(n, std::memory_order_relaxed);
}

void threadB() {
    Node* n = nullptr;
    while ((n = node.load(std::memory_order_relaxed)) == nullptr) {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::nanoseconds(50)); // Small sleep to improve scheduling
    }
    if (n->x != 42) {
        std::cerr << "Race condition detected: n->x = " << n->x << std::endl;
        std::terminate();
    }
}

void runTest() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) { // Run many iterations but eventually time out
        node.store(nullptr, std::memory_order_relaxed);
        std::thread t1(threadA);
        std::thread t2(threadB);
        std::thread t3(threadA);
        std::thread t4(threadA);
        t1.join();
        t2.join();
        t3.join();
        t4.join();
        delete node.load();
    }
}

int main() {
    runTest();
    std::cout << "No Race Condition Occurred in this run" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The code snippet above is a trivial example of a data race condition. Thread A creates a node variable and assigns it the number 42. On the otherhand, thread B checks than the variable assigned to the Node is equal to 42. Both functions use the `memory_order_relaxed` model, which allows the possibility for thread B to read an unintialised variable before it has been assigned the value 42 in thread A. 

Compile the source code with the command below. 

```bash
g++ relaxed_memory_ordering.cpp -o relaxed_memory_ordering -O3
```

Run the command below to run the binary 10 times. We run the binary 10 times to increase the chance of observing a race condition. 

```bash
for i in {1..10};do ./relaxed_memory_ordering; done;
```

If you do not see a race condition, the animation below shows a race condition being triggered on the 3rd time.

As the graphic above illustrates, a race condition is not a guarantee but a probability.  Our contrived example is designed to trigger frequently. Unfortunately, in production workloads there may be a more subtle probability that may surface in production or under specific workloads. This is the reason race conditions are difficult to spot.

### Behaviour on x86 instance

Due to the more strong memory model associated with x86 processors, programs that do not adhere to the C++ standard may give programmers a false sense of security. To demonstrate this I connected to an AWS `t2.2xlarge` instance that uses the x86 architecture. 

Running the following command I can observe the underlying hardware is a Intel Xeon E5-2686 Processor

```bash
lscpu | grep -i "Model"
```

```output
Model name:                           Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2686 v4 @ 2.30GHz
Model:                                79
```
Follow the instructions above and recompiling leads to no race conditions on this x86-based machine.  

```output
./relaxed_memory_ordering 
No race condition occurred in this run
```


## Using correct memory ordering of Atomics

As the example above shows, not adhering to the C++ standard can lead to a false sensitivity when running on x86 platforms. To fix the race condition when porting we need to use the correct memory ordering for each thread. The following snippet of C++ updates `threadA` to use the `memory_order_release`, `threadB` to use `memory_order_acquire` and the `runTest` fuction to use `memory_order_release` on the Node object. 

Save the adjusted code snippet below into a file named `correct_memory_ordering.cpp`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
#include <cassert>
#include <chrono>

struct Node {
    int x;
};
std::atomic<Node*> node{nullptr};

void threadA() {
    auto n = new Node();
    n->x = 42;
    node.store(n, std::memory_order_release);
}

void threadB() {
    Node* n = nullptr;
    while ((n = node.load(std::memory_order_acquire)) == nullptr) {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::nanoseconds(50)); // Small sleep to improve scheduling
    }
    if (n->x != 42) {
        std::cerr << "Race condition detected: n->x = " << n->x << std::endl;
        std::terminate();
    }
}

void runTest() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) { // Run many iterations but eventually time out
        node.store(nullptr, std::memory_order_release);
        std::thread t1(threadA);
        std::thread t2(threadB);
        std::thread t3(threadA);
        std::thread t4(threadA);
        t1.join();
        t2.join();
        t3.join();
        t4.join();
        delete node.load();
    }
}

int main() {
    runTest();
    std::cout << "No Race Condition Occurred in this run" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```

Compiling with the following command and run on an Aarch64 based machine. 

```bash
g++ correct_memory_ordering.cpp -o correct_memory_ordering -O3
```

```output
./correct_memory_ordering 
No Race Condition Occurred in this run
```
