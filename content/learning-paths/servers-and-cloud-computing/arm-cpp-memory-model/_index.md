title: Learn about the C++ memory model for porting applications to Arm

minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for C++ developers porting applications from x86 to Arm and optimizing performance.

learning_objectives: 
    - Describe at a high level what a memory model does, and the types of memory ordering.
    - Describe the differences between the Arm and x86 memory model.
    - Employ best practices for writing C++ on Arm to avoid race conditions.

prerequisites:
    - Access to an x86 and an Arm cloud instance (virtual machine).
    - Proficiency in C++ programming.
