minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to set up a pipeline in the cloud for recommendation models. You will build and run the benchmark using MLPerf and PyTorch.

learning_objectives:
    - build the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) using a Docker image
    - run a modified performant DLRMv2 benchmark and inspect the results

prerequisites:
    - An Arm-based cloud instance with at lest 400GB of RAM and 800 GB of disk space
