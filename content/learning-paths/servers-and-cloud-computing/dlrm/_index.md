title: Building and Benchmarking DLRM on Arm Neoverse V2 with MLPerf


minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to set up a pipeline in the cloud for recommendation models. You'll build and run the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) and benchmark its performance using MLPerf and PyTorch.

learning_objectives:
    - Build the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM). 
    - Run a modified performant DLRMv2 benchmark and inspect the results.

prerequisites:
    - Any [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider (CSP), or an on-premise Arm server with at least 400GB of RAM and 800 GB of disk space.
