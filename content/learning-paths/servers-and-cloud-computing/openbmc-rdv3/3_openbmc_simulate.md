## Prepare pre-silicon OpenBMC simulation

With your environment ready, you can simulate the full pre-silicon firmware boot flow using the Arm Neoverse RD-V3 r1 reference design. You’ll build the OpenBMC image, launch the Arm Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP), and observe the boot of both the BMC and host UEFI firmware.

This simulation launches multiple UART consoles, each in a separate terminal window for different subsystems (for example, Neoverse V3, Cortex-M55, Cortex-M7, and the Cortex-A BMC). These graphical terminals require a desktop session. If you’re connecting over SSH only, they won’t render.

Install a remote desktop environment with XRDP:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y xrdp xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies xterm pv sshpass socat
echo xfce4-session > ~/.xsession
sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert
sudo systemctl enable --now xrdp
```

If you use GNOME on the server, you may need the networking and GDM tweaks in Step 2 of the [RD-V3 Learning Path](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/neoverse-rdv3-swstack/4_rdv3_on_fvp/).

Once connected through Remote Desktop, open a terminal and launch the RD-V3 FVP simulation.

## Execute pre-silicon OpenBMC simulation

Download the helper script from Arm’s GitLab:

```bash
cd ~
wget https://gitlab.arm.com/server_management/PoCs/fvp-poc/-/raw/2a79ae93560969a3b802dfb3d7d89f9fd9dee5a6/run.sh
```

Before running the simulation, open the `run.sh` script and locate the line that defines `FVP_KEYWORD`.
This variable determines when the host FVP should be launched by monitoring OpenBMC’s console output.

If not set correctly, the script might hang or fail to start the host simulation.
Update the line to:

```output
FVP_KEYWORD="terminal2: Listening for serial connection on port"
```

Then, execute the script:

```bash
chmod +x ./run.sh
./run.sh -m ~/FVP_RD_V3_R1/models/Linux64_GCC-9.3/FVP_RD_V3_R1
```

The script will:

- Launch the OpenBMC FVP and wait for BMC boot
- Start the host FVP for RD-V3 r1 (UEFI)
- Bridge UART consoles between BMC and host using virtual pipes
- Create MCTP and IPMI tunnels between the OpenBMC FVP and the host FVP
- Stop both FVPs when you press Ctrl+C

When running, the **OpenBMC FVP console** stops at a Linux login prompt:

```output

Log in with user `root` and password `0penBmc`.

{{% notice Note %}}
The first character of the password is the number **0** (zero), not a capital **O**.
{{% /notice %}}

The host-side UEFI appears in the **FVP terminal_ns_uart0** window. You might briefly see the UEFI firmware setup. 

Select **Continue** to proceed, then GRUB appears and Linux boots:

The simulation proceeds to the **CSSv3 r1** GRUB menu. Press **Enter** to boot.

A successful run shows login prompts on both BMC and host consoles. You can also confirm final state in the Web UI or using UART output.

Shown here is a short recording that illustrates OpenBMC and UEFI interaction during pre-silicon execution.

After the simulation, logs for both BMC and host are stored in `~/logs`:

- `obmc_boot.log`  BMC boot output
- `obmc_console.log`  BMC serial output
- `fvp_boot.log`  Host UEFI boot output

Tail them to verify behavior or troubleshoot:

```bash
tail -n +1 ~/logs/* | less -R
```

With the simulation running successfully, you’re ready to exercise host↔BMC flows. You'll now move on to interact with the BMC using UART and IPMI from the host to validate pre-silicon communication paths.
