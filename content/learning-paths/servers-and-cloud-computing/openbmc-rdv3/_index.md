title: Simulate OpenBMC and UEFI pre-silicon on Neoverse RD-V3

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This advanced topic is for firmware developers, platform software engineers, and system integrators working on Arm Neoverse-based platforms. It is especially useful for developers exploring pre-silicon development, testing, and integration of Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC) with UEFI firmware. If you are building or validating server-class reference platforms such as RD-V3, before hardware is available, this Learning Path shows you how to simulate and debug the full boot path using Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs).

learning_objectives:
  - Understand the role of OpenBMC and UEFI in the Arm server boot flow
  - Simulate the firmware using the RD-V3 FVP
  - Build and launch OpenBMC and UEFI images on the RD-V3 FVP
  - Validate hostâ€“BMC communication using UART and Serial over LAN (SoL)
  - Implement and validate a custom IPMI command in OpenBMC

prerequisites:
  - An Arm Neoverse-based Linux machine (cloud or local) running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  - At least 80 GB free disk space and 48 GB RAM
  - Working knowledge of Docker, Git, and common Linux terminal tools
  - Basic understanding of the server firmware stack (such as UEFI, BMC, and TF-A)
