# Conclusion 
By leveraging the Streamline tool together with a good understanding of the llama.cpp code, the execution process of the LLM model can be visualized, which helps analyze code efficiency and investigate potential optimization.

Note that additional annotation code in llama.cpp and gatord might somehow affect the performance.
