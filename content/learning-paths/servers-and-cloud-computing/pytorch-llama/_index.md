title: Run a Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot with PyTorch using KleidiAI on Arm servers

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in running LLMs using PyTorch on Arm-based servers. 

learning_objectives:
    - Download the Meta Llama 3.1 model from the Meta Hugging Face repository.
    - 4-bit quantize the model using optimized INT4 KleidiAI Kernels for PyTorch.
    - Run an LLM inference using PyTorch on an Arm-based CPU.
    - Expose an LLM inference as a browser application with Streamlit as the frontend and Torchchat framework in PyTorch as the LLM backend server.
    - Measure performance metrics of the LLM inference running on an Arm-based CPU.

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) with at least 16 CPUs from a cloud service provider or an on-premise Arm server.
