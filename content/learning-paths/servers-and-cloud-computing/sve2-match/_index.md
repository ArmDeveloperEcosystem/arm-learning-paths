title: Accelerate search performance with SVE2 MATCH on Arm servers

    
minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for database developers, performance engineers, and anyone optimizing data processing workloads on Arm-based cloud instances.


learning_objectives:
  - Understand the purpose and function of SVE2 MATCH instructions.
  - Implement a search algorithm using both scalar and SVE2-based MATCH approaches.
  - Benchmark and compare performance between scalar and vectorized implementations.
  - Analyze speedups and efficiency gains on Arm Neoverse-based instances with SVE2.

prerequisites:
- Access to an [AWS Graviton4, Google Axion, or Azure Cobalt 100 virtual machine](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider.
