## Cobalt 100 Arm-based processor

Azure’s Cobalt 100 is Microsoft’s first-generation Arm-based processor. Built on the Arm Neoverse N2 architecture, the 64-bit CPU improves performance and energy efficiency for a wide range of cloud-native, scale-out Linux workloads. These include web and application servers, data analytics, open-source databases, caching systems, and more. Running at 3.4 GHz, the Cobalt 100 processor allocates a dedicated physical core for each vCPU to ensure consistent, predictable performance.

See the [Azure Cobalt 100 announcement blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurecompute/announcing-the-preview-of-new-azure-vms-based-on-the-azure-cobalt-100-processor/4146353) to find out more.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL database known for high performance, scalability, and flexibility. It stores data in JSON-like BSON documents, making it ideal for applications that need dynamic, schema-less data structures. Developers commonly use MongoDB for web, mobile, IoT, and real-time analytics workloads. 

To find out more, see the [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/) and the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).
