## Cobalt 100 Arm-based processor

Azure’s Cobalt 100 is built on Microsoft's first-generation, in-house Arm-based processor: the Cobalt 100. Designed entirely by Microsoft and based on Arm’s Neoverse N2 architecture, this 64-bit CPU delivers improved performance and energy efficiency across a broad spectrum of cloud-native, scale-out Linux workloads. These include web and application servers, data analytics, open-source databases, caching systems, and more. Running at 3.4 GHz, the Cobalt 100 processor allocates a dedicated physical core for each vCPU, ensuring consistent and predictable performance. 

To learn more about Cobalt 100, refer to the blog [Announcing the preview of new Azure virtual machine based on the Azure Cobalt 100 processor](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurecompute/announcing-the-preview-of-new-azure-vms-based-on-the-azure-cobalt-100-processor/4146353).

## MongoDB
MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility.

It stores data in JSON-like BSON documents, making it ideal for modern applications that require dynamic, schema-less data structures.

MongoDB is widely used for web, mobile, IoT, and real-time analytics workloads. Learn more from the [MongoDB official website](https://www.mongodb.com/) and its [official documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).
