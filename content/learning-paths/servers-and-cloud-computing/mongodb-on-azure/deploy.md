## Install MongoDB and Mongosh on the Ubuntu Pro 24.04 LTS Arm instance

Install MongoDB and mongosh on Ubuntu Pro 24.04 LTS Arm64 by downloading the binaries, setting up environment paths, configuring data and log directories, and starting the server for local access and verification.

1. Install System Dependencies

Install required system packages to support MongoDB:
```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl wget tar fio openssl libcurl4 net-tools
```

2. Download and Extract MongoDB

Fetch and unpack the MongoDB binaries for Arm64:
```console
wget https://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-aarch64-ubuntu2404-8.0.12.tgz
tar -xvzf mongodb-linux-aarch64-ubuntu2404-8.0.12.tgz
sudo mv mongodb-linux-aarch64-ubuntu2404-8.0.12 /usr/local/mongodb
```

3. Add MongoDB to System PATH

Enable running MongoDB from any terminal session:
```console
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/mongodb/bin:$PATH' | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/mongodb.sh
source /etc/profile.d/mongodb.sh
```

4. Create data and log directories to use with MongoDB:

Set up the database data directory:
```console
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/mongo
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/mongodb
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/lib/mongo /var/log/mongodb
```

5. Start MongoDB Server 

You can start MongoDB manually as shown:
```console
mongod --dbpath /var/lib/mongo --logpath /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log --fork
```

The output from this command should look like:
```output
about to fork child process, waiting until server is ready for connections.
forked process: 3356
child process started successfully, parent exiting
```

6. Install mongosh

**mongosh** is the MongoDB Shell used to interact with your MongoDB server. It provides a modern, user-friendly CLI for running queries and database operations.

Download and install MongoDBâ€™s command-line shell for Arm:
```console
wget https://downloads.mongodb.com/compass/mongosh-2.3.8-linux-arm64.tgz
tar -xvzf mongosh-2.3.8-linux-arm64.tgz
sudo mv mongosh-2.3.8-linux-arm64 /usr/local/mongosh
```
Add mongosh to  System `PATH`
```console
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/mongosh/bin:$PATH' | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/mongosh.sh
source /etc/profile.d/mongosh.sh
```

### Verify MongoDB and mongosh Installation

Check if MongoDB and mongosh are properly installed on your machine:
```console
mongod --version
mongosh --version
```
You should see output similar to: 
```output
db version v8.0.12
Build Info: {
    "version": "8.0.12",
    "gitVersion": "b60fc6875b5fb4b63cc0dbbd8dda0d6d6277921a",
    "openSSLVersion": "OpenSSL 3.0.13 30 Jan 2024",
    "modules": [],
    "allocator": "tcmalloc-google",
    "environment": {
        "distmod": "ubuntu2404",
        "distarch": "aarch64",
        "target_arch": "aarch64"
    }
}
2.3.8
```

### Connect to MongoDB via mongosh

You can now start interacting with MongoDB through its shell interface:
```console
mongosh mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
```
You should see output on your terminal similar to: 
```output
Current Mongosh Log ID: 68b573411523231d81a00aa0
Connecting to:          mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+2.3.8
Using MongoDB:          8.0.12
Using Mongosh:          2.3.8
mongosh 2.5.7 is available for download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

```

With this you have verified that the MongoDB installation is complete. You can now proceed with the baseline testing of MongoDB on your Azure Cobalt 100 based VM.
