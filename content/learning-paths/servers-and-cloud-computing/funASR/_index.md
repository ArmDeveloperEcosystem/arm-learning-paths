title: Deploy ModelScope FunASR Chinese Speech Recognition Model on Arm Servers

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers and AI engineers interested in learning how to run Chinese Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) applications on Arm servers.

learning_objectives:
    - Utilize open-source large language model and tools to build Chinese ASR applications.
    - Deploy Chinese real-time speech recognition, punctuation restoration and sentiment analysis with FunASR.
    - Understand how to accelerate ModelScope models on Arm based servers for performance and efficiency.

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider, or a local Arm Linux computer with at least 8 CPUs and 16 GB RAM.
