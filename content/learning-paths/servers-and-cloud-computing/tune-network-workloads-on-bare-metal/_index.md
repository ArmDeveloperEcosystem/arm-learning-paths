title: Tune network workloads on Arm-based bare-metal instances

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for engineers who want to tune the performance of network workloads on Arm Neoverse-based bare-metal instances.

learning_objectives: 
    - Set up Apache Tomcat and wrk2 to benchmark HTTP on an Arm Neoverse bare‑metal host
    - Establish a reproducible baseline baseline (file‑descriptor limits, logging, thread counts, fixed core set)
    - Tune NIC queue count to match available cores and measure impact
    - Improve NUMA locality by placing Tomcat on the NIC’s NUMA node and aligning worker threads with cores
    - Compare IOMMU strict mode and IOMMU passthrough mode, and select the configuration that delivers the best performance for your workload

prerequisites:
    - An Arm Neoverse-based bare-metal server running Ubuntu 24.04 to run Apache Tomcat
    - Access to an x86_64 bare-metal server running Ubuntu 24.04 to run `wrk2`
    - Basic familiarity with Java applications
