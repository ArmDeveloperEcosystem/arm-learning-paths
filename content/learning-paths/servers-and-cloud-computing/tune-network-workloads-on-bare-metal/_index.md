minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for engineers who want to tune the performance of network workloads on Arm Neoverse-based bare-metal.

learning_objectives: 
    - Set up a benchmarking environment using Tomcat and wrk2
    - Baseline of optimal performance configuration before tuning
    - Tune network workloads performance with NIC queue
    - Tune network workloads performance with local NUMA
    - Tune network workloads performance with iommu.strict and iommu.passthrough

prerequisites:
    - Access to an Arm-based bare-metal running Ubuntu-24 (you can use a Grace) (for Tomcat)
    - Access to a x86-based bare-metal running Ubuntu-24 (you can use an any x86_64 bare-metal) (for wrk2)
    - Basic familiarity with Java applications
    - Basic familiarity with computer system, network communication, etc.
