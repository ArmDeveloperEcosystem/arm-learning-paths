title: Get started with parallel application development

minutes_to_complete: 30   

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for HPC software developers writing MPI applications.

learning_objectives: 
    - Debug and fix a parallel application
    - Profile and optimize your code
    - Use optimized routines for common math operations

prerequisites:
    - General knowledge about distributed parallelism (MPI)
    - Some understanding of C, Python, and Linux commands
    - An Arm computer running Linux. Cloud instances can be used, refer to the list of [Arm cloud service providers](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/).
