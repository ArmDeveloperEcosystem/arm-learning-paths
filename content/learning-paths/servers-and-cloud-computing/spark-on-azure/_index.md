title: Run Spark applications on Microsoft Azure Cobalt 100 processors

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic that introduces Spark deployment on Microsoft Azure Cobalt 100 (Arm-based) virtual machines. It is designed for developers migrating Spark applications from x86_64 to Arm.

learning_objectives: 
    - Provision an Azure Arm64 virtual machine using Azure console
    - Learn how to create an Azure Linux 3.0 Docker container
    - Deploy a Spark application inside an Azure Linux 3.0 Arm64-based Docker container or an Azure Linux 3.0 custom-image based Azure virtual machine
    - Run a suite of Spark benchmarks to understand and evaluate performance on the Azure Cobalt 100 virtual machine

prerequisites:
    - A [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account with access to Cobalt 100 based instances (Dpsv6)
    - A machine with [Docker](/install-guides/docker/) installed
    - Familiarity with distributed computing concepts and the [Apache Spark architecture](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/)
