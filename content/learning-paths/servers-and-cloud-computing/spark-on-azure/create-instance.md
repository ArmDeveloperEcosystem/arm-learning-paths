## Introduction

There are several ways to create an Arm-based Cobalt 100 virtual machine : the Microsoft Azure console, the Azure CLI tool, or using your choice of IaC (Infrastructure as Code). This guide will use the Azure console to create a virtual machine with Arm-based Cobalt 100 Processor.

This learning path focuses on the general-purpose virtual machine of the D series. Please read the guide on [Dpsv6 size series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/dpsv6-series) offered by Microsoft Azure.

If you have never used the Microsoft Cloud Platform before, please review the microsoft [guide to Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?tabs=ubuntu).

#### Create an Arm-based Azure Virtual Machine

Creating a virtual machine based on Azure Cobalt 100 is no different from creating any other virtual machine in Azure. To create an Azure virtual machine, launch the Azure portal and navigate to Virtual Machines.

Select “Create”, and fill in the details such as Name, and Region. Choose the image for your virtual machine (for example – Ubuntu 24.04) and select “Arm64” as the virtual machine architecture.

In the “Size” field, click on “See all sizes” and select the D-Series v6 family of Virtual machine. Select “D4ps_v6” from the list and create the virtual machine.

The virtual machine should be ready and running; you can SSH into the virtual machine using the PEM key, along with the Public IP details.
