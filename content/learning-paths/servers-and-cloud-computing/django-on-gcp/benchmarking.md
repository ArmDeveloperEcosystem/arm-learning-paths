## Django Benchmarking using ApacheBench
This section describes how to benchmark a Django web application deployed with **Gunicorn** using **ApacheBench (ab)** — a lightweight HTTP benchmarking tool.  
You will measure **throughput (requests per second)** and **latency (response time)** to evaluate the performance of your Django app on an Arm-based GCP SUSE VM.

### Ensure ApacheBench is installed
**ApacheBench (ab)** is a command-line tool used to benchmark web servers by simulating multiple HTTP requests.

Install it using following command:

```console
sudo zypper install -y apache2-utils
```
**Verify installation:**

This confirms ApacheBench is correctly installed and available system-wide.

```console
ab -V
```

### Activate Django Virtual Environment
A virtual environment isolates Python dependencies for your Django project to prevent version conflicts.

```console
cd ~/myproject
source venv/bin/activate
```
When activated, your shell prompt should show (`venv`) — indicating you’re inside the virtual environment.

**Ensure Django and Gunicorn are installed:**

```console
pip install django gunicorn
```
- **Django** is the Python web framework you’re benchmarking.
- **Gunicorn** is a high-performance WSGI HTTP server for deploying Django apps in production-like environments.

### Run Django Migrations and Collect Static Files
Before running the server, initialize the database and prepare static files.

```console
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```
- `migrate` applies database schema changes (like creating tables).
- `collectstatic` gathers static assets (CSS, JS, images) into a single directory for efficient serving.

This ensures your Django project is fully configured and ready for deployment under Gunicorn.

### Run Django with Gunicorn
Use Gunicorn to serve your Django application for benchmarking:

```console
gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 4
```

- `--workers 4`: number of worker processes
- `--bind 0.0.0.0:8000`: binds to all interfaces on port 8000
- Replace `myproject.wsgi:application` with your actual Django project name.

{{% notice Note %}}
Keep this terminal running during the benchmark. If you’re testing remotely, ensure port 8000 is open in your VM firewall settings.

### Benchmark with ApacheBench (ab)
Run ApacheBench to simulate multiple clients hitting your Django server.

```console
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
- `-n 1000`: total number of requests
- `-c 10`: concurrency (simultaneous requests)

You should see an output similar to:

### Benchmark Metrics Explanation

- **Concurrency Level:** Number of requests executed simultaneously during the test.  
- **Time Taken for Tests:** Total time required to complete all HTTP requests.  
- **Complete Requests:** Total number of successful requests processed.  
- **Failed Requests:** Number of requests that failed or returned errors.  
- **Total Transferred:** Total amount of data (including headers) sent and received.  
- **HTML Transferred:** Amount of actual response content transferred.  
- **Requests per Second:** Average number of requests handled by the server per second.  
- **Time per Request (mean):** Average time taken to process a single request.  
- **Time per Request (across concurrent):** Mean time per request across all concurrent clients.  
- **Transfer Rate:** Average network data throughput during the benchmark.
