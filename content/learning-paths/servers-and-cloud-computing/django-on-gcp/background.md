## Explore Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Google’s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

To learn more, see the Google blog [Introducing Google Axion Processors, our new Arm-based CPUs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu).


## Explore Django on Google Axion C4A (Arm Neoverse V2)

Django is a high-level, open-source Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Developed and maintained by the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/), it simplifies web application development by handling much of the boilerplate and providing powerful built-in features.

Django follows the Model–View–Template (MVT) architectural pattern and includes robust tools for authentication, URL routing, form handling, ORM (Object Relational Mapping), session management, and administration interface - all out of the box.

Django is known for its focus on security, scalability, and maintainability, making it suitable for everything from small projects to large-scale enterprise applications. It helps developers build secure, high-performance web applications quickly without reinventing common components.

Common use cases include web applications, content management systems, APIs, e-commerce platforms, and data-driven dashboards. It integrates seamlessly with popular databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle.

To learn more, visit the [Django website](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and explore the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/).

## What you've accomplished and what's next

In this section, you learned about:
- Google Axion C4A Arm-based VMs and their performance characteristics
- Django web framework and its suitability for building REST APIs
- How Arm architecture provides cost-effective, high-performance infrastructure for Python applications

Next, you'll configure firewall rules to allow external access to your Django application.
