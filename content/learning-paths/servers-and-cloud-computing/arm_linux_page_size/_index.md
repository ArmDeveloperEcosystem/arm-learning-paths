minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who want to modify the Linux kernel page size on Arm-based systems to improve performance for memory-intensive workloads.

learning_objectives:
  - Verify the current page size on your system.
  - Install the 64K page size kernel specific to your OS.
  - Verify the new 64K page size is active.
  - Revert to the default 4K page size kernel (optional).

prerequisites:
  - An Arm-based Linux system running Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS.
