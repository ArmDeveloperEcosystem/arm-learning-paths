## How do I configure my GitHub Application to use my API?

Open the GitHub App that you created in the first GitHub Copilot Extension Learning Path, [Build a GitHub Copilot Extension in Python](../../gh-copilot-simple).

Navigate to the **Copilot** tab, and add your URL to the field under the **Agent Definition** section:

 ![Configure URL](configure.png)

Now update the **Callback URL** in the **General** tab. This is the complete URL to which GitHub redirects after a user authorizes an installation.

## Test your Extension

Now that your Extension is production-ready, it is time to test it. 

For guidance on testing, see [Test your Copilot Extension](../../gh-copilot-simple/copilot-test/) in the previous Copilot Extension Learning Path.

## Next Steps

You are now ready to build a more advanced Copilot Extension using RAG techniques. 

To discover how do to this, see the Learning Path [Create a RAG-based GitHub Copilot Extension in Python](../../copilot-extension).
