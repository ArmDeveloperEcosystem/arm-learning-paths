## Setting up the Pulumi
You will now set up Pulumi on Windows for Azure. Follow these steps to install the required tools:
1.	Install Node.js for Arm64 by downloading and running the following installer: https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.9.0/node-v20.9.0-arm64.msi. 
2.	Install Pulumi CLI. Here is the link to the installer: https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-winget/releases/download/v3.92.0/pulumi-3.92.0-windows-x64.msi. 
3.	Install Azure CLI for Windows using this installer: https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindowsx64 
4.	Go to the Pulumi website (pulumi.com) and create a new account.

Now, you will create the Pulumi project for Azure:
1.	Open the Windows Command Prompt, and then type
```console
az login
```

A command will open the web browser and let you login to your Azure subscription.
2.	Using the Command Prompt, create a new folder for your project by typing 
```console
mkdir azure-aci
```

3.	Then, change the working directory to azure-aci:
```console
cd azure-aci
```

4.	Create the new Pulumi project for Azure using the following command:
```console
pulumi new azure-typescript
```

The last command starts the wizard, in which you first need to log in to Pulumi (see below).

You can use the access token or press ENTER to log in using a web browser.

After you log in to Pulumi, configure the project as follows:
1.	Project name (azure-aci): **press enter to keep the default**.
2.	Project description: **press enter to keep the default**.
3.	Stack name: **dev**.
4.	azure-native-location: **EastUS**.

The wizard will save this configuration and proceed to install the npm packages required by Pulumi:
