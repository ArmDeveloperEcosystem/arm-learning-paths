title: Build and Run vLLM on Arm Servers

minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers and AI engineers interested in learning how to use the vLLM library on Arm servers.

learning_objectives:
    - Build vLLM from source on an Arm server.
    - Download a Qwen LLM from Hugging Face.
    - Run local batch inference using vLLM.
    - Create and interact with an OpenAI-compatible server provided by vLLM on your Arm server.

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider, or a local Arm Linux computer with at least 8 CPUs and 16 GB RAM.
