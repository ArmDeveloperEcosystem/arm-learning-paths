    - Explain what a RAG system is.
    - Create vector embeddings for a RAG knowledge base.
    - Implement RAG in a Copilot Extension.
    - Configure a GitHub Copilot Extension for your RAG application.

prerequisites:
    - The [Build a GitHub Copilot Extension in Python](../gh-copilot-simple/) Learning Path.
    - The [Graviton Infrastructure for GitHub Copilot Extensions](../copilot-extension-deployment/) Learning Path.
    - A GitHub account.

weight: 1                       # _index.md always has weight of 1 to order correctly
layout: "learningpathall"       # All files under learning paths have this same wrapper
learning_path_main_page: "yes"  # This should be surfaced when looking for related content. Only set for _index.md of learning path content.
