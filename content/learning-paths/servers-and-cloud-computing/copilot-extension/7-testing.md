## Publish Your Extension on the Marketplace (Optional)

For the latest information on how to publish your extension on the Marketplace, follow the [official documentation for listing your extension on the marketplace](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/managing-the-availability-of-your-copilot-extension#listing-your-copilot-extension-on-the-github-marketplace).

## Enhancements

There are several ways to enhance your extension:

* Custom Links - inserting your own hard-coded links or resources into the response stream.

* Improved conversation flow - consider adding another copilot invocation to rephrase previous conversation segments before initiating the main copilot invocation. This can produce more robust results, especially when users reference earlier parts of the conversation in their question.

Tailor these possible enhancements of your RAG extension to your use case, making your extension as effective and user-friendly as possible.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing this Learning Path! By following the steps and processes you learned here, you can now create powerful and customized Copilot extensions to boost your development workflow.
