## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is an open-source, strongly typed programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.  

It is a superset of JavaScript, which means all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript, but TypeScript adds **static typing, interfaces, and advanced tooling** to help developers write more reliable and maintainable code.  

TypeScript is widely used for **web applications, server-side development (Node.js), and large-scale JavaScript projects** where type safety and code quality are important. Learn more from the [TypeScript official website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and its [handbook and documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).
