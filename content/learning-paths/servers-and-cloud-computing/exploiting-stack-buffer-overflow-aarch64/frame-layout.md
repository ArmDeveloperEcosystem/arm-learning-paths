To build a stack buffer overflow based exploit, you first need to
understand how variables, function arguments and return values are laid
out on the stack.

In this section, you will learn how the `clang` compiler lays out the stack frame.

Using a file editor, save the contents of the program shown below into a file named `stack-layout.c`. Save the file in the directory where you ran `docker run`. You can do this outside the docker container.

```C
__attribute__((noinline))
long f() {
    volatile char buffer1[4];
    volatile char buffer2[7];
    buffer1[3] = 10;
    buffer2[6] = 20;
    return buffer1[3]+buffer2[6];
}

int main() {
    f();
    return 0;
}
```

The file will show up in the docker container under the path
`/armlearningpaths`.

Compile it with the following command at your docker prompt:

```bash { command_line="root@7a8fb34f810e:/armlearningpaths|2-3" }
clang -O1 -S -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables stack-layout.c
```

This produces the disassembly file `stack-layout.s`. When you open it, you see the
following disassembly for function `f`:

```asm
	sub	sp, sp, #16
	mov	w8, #10
	mov	w9, #20
	strb	w8, [sp, #12]
	strb	w9, [sp, #8]
	ldrb	w8, [sp, #12]
	ldrb	w9, [sp, #8]
	add	x0, x9, x8
	add	sp, sp, #16
	ret
```

Here you can see that the first instruction `sub sp, sp #16` reserves 16 bytes on the
stack as the stack frame for this function. The stack on AArch64 grows
downwards, which means it grows towards the lower memory addresses.

The next 4 instructions store value `10` and `20` to `buffer1[3]` and
`buffer2[6]`.

From the offset `[sp, #8]` and `[sp, #12]` you can compute the frame layout.

Draw the frame layout of function `f`: How are `buffer1` and `buffer2` laid out
in the 16 bytes that are reserved?

For the `main` function, `clang` produces the following assembly:

```asm
	stp	x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!           // 16-byte Folded Spill
	mov	x29, sp
	bl	f
	mov	w0, wzr
	ldp	x29, x30, [sp], #16             // 16-byte Folded Reload
	ret
```

The `bl f` instruction in the middle performs a function call to function `f`.
It writes the address of the instruction after it -- in this case `mov w0, wzr`
-- to register `x30`. Then it lets the program continue to the first instruction
of function `f`.

Register `x30` is also often called the _link register_, or `lr`.

The `ret` instruction at the end of the main function will branch to the address
stored in register `x30`. The correct address that function `main` should return
to was set by a `bl main` instruction somewhere else in the program.

Because the `bl f` instruction overwrites the value in `x30`, the original value
in `x30` at the start of function `main` needs to be saved somewhere. It is
saved on the stack by the instruction `stp x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!`.

The `stp` instruction is a "store pair" instruction. It stores 2 registers to a
location in memory. The location in memory in this case is `[sp, #-16]!`, that is
the address in register `sp` (also known as the stack pointer), at an offset of
-16. The exclamation mark indicates that the value in register `sp` should be
updated to the value with the offset. In other words, after this instruction
executes, `sp` will have a value that is 16 less than before the instruction
executes. `[sp, #-16]!` is a
[Pre-index addressing mode](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102374/0101/Loads-and-stores---addressing) type of instruction.
  
Register `x29` contains the
"[frame pointer](https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/main/aapcs64/aapcs64.rst#the-frame-pointer)",
and is sometimes called `fp`. The frame pointer points to a location in the
stack frame that contains the "frame record". The frame record has two
fields: a pointer to the frame record of the function that called the current
function; and the address the current function needs to return to.

At the start of function `main`, it contains the value of the frame pointer of
the previous function. Since the function `f` that is being called might change
the value of `x29`, that value also needs to be stored in the function prologue.
It will be restored by the instruction `ldp x29, x30, [sp], #16` in the function
epilogue. `[sp], #16` is a
[post-index addressing mode](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102374/0101/Loads-and-stores---addressing) type of instruction:
it specifies to load from the address in register `sp`, and then to increase the
value in `sp` with 16.

{{% notice "Exercise 2" %}}

Draw the frame layout of function `main`.

* Which variables or register values are stored on the stack at which location?
* Where do the frame pointer (`x29`) and stack pointer (`sp`) point to just
  before the call to function `f`, which is done by instruction `bl f`?
