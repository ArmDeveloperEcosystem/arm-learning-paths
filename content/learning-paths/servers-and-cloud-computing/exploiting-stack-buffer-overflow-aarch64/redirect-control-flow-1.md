### FIXED, DO NOT MODIFY

In the previous section you saw that a stack buffer overflow can change the return address of a function. In this section, you are going to explicitly choose the value that gets written to the location where the return address is stored. The goal is to modify the behavior of the program without making it crash.

In this section, you will go through the simplest possible example for doing so.

The example from the previous section has been slightly modified to the contents shown below. Save the modified content into a file named `redirect1.c`:

```C
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__attribute__((noinline))
char f(char *src) {
    char buffer[8];

    strcpy(buffer, src);
    return buffer[2];
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    char *chars = argv[1];
    f(chars);
    puts("The string on the command line was: ");
    puts(chars);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile it with the following command at your docker prompt:

```bash { command_line="root@7a8fb34f810e:/armlearningpaths|2-3" }
clang -g -O1 redirect1.c -o redirect1
```

Now run this program:
```bash { command_line="root@7a8fb34f810e:/armlearningpaths|2-3" }
./redirect1 hello
The string on the command line was:
hello
```

It produces the expected output, as long as the string provided is 15 characters
or less. When the string is longer, there is a buffer overflow and the stored return address is overwritten.

Let's test if you can still get the bus error as seen in the program in the previous
section if you provide the string that was hard-coded in that program:

```bash { command_line="root@7a8fb34f810e:/armlearningpaths|2-30" }
./redirect1 "These are 24 chars. yes"
Bus error
```
Yes, you can.

We assume that an attacker can control the input to the program, that is the string
argument on the command line. Could you as an attacker craft a string such that
the program does not crash but still change the behavior of the program?

Let's investigate.

You haven't changed function `f`, and the assembly instructions that the compiler
generates from it haven't changed. That means that the function will return to
the address that is encoded in bytes 16 to 23 in the string it processes, which
is the string on the command line.

Start by looking at the disassembly of the main function to see if you can find an
interesting address to return to:

```bash { command_line="root@7a8fb34f810e:/armlearningpaths|2-30" }
gdb -q ./redirect1
Reading symbols from ./redirect1...
```

```text { output_lines = "2-30" }
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x808: file redirect1.c, line 13.
```

```text { output_lines = "2-30" }

13          char *chars = argv[1];
```

```text { output_lines = "2-30" }
(gdb) disass main
Dump of assembler code for function main:

   0x0000aaaaaaaa0834 <+56>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
```

You see that function `f` is called by the `bl 0xaaaaaaaa07d4` instruction at address
`0xaaaaaaaa0810`. The `bl` instruction stores the address of the instruction
after it in register `x30`, so you expect that the return address that will be
seen in function `f` is `0xaaaaaaaa0814`.

Let's check to see if that is the case.

```text { output_lines = "2-30" }
(gdb) break f
Breakpoint 2 at 0xaaaaaaaa07e4: file redirect1.c, line 8.
```

```text { output_lines = "2-30" }
(gdb) cont
Continuing.

Breakpoint 2, f (src=src@entry=0x0) at redirect1.c:8
8           strcpy(buffer, src);
```

```text { output_lines = "2-30" }
(gdb) disass f
Dump of assembler code for function f:
   0x0000aaaaaaaa07d4 <+0>:     sub     sp, sp, #0x20
   0x0000aaaaaaaa07d8 <+4>:     stp     x29, x30, [sp, #16]
   0x0000aaaaaaaa07dc <+8>:     add     x29, sp, #0x10
   0x0000aaaaaaaa07e0 <+12>:    mov     x1, x0
=> 0x0000aaaaaaaa07e4 <+16>:    add     x0, sp, #0x8
   0x0000aaaaaaaa07e8 <+20>:    bl      0xaaaaaaaa0680 <strcpy@plt>
   0x0000aaaaaaaa07ec <+24>:    ldp     x29, x30, [sp, #16]
   0x0000aaaaaaaa07f0 <+28>:    ldrb    w0, [sp, #10]
   0x0000aaaaaaaa07f4 <+32>:    add     sp, sp, #0x20
   0x0000aaaaaaaa07f8 <+36>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
```

```text { output_lines = "2-30" }
(gdb) info register x30
x30            0xaaaaaaaa0814      187649984432148
```

Indeed, the return address in x30 is as expected.

Now you can try to change that return address by specifying a specially crafted string
as the program argument, so that the program does not print the string
`"The string on the command line was: "`. In the disassembly
of function `main` printed earlier in this section, you can see 2 calls to the
function `puts` (Look for the `bl 0xaaaaaaaa0670 <puts@plt>` instructions).
If you can point the return address to just beyond the first `puts` call, then
that first `puts` call should not be executed anymore, as the program's control
flow will never go through that instruction anymore.

The address of the instruction after that first `puts` call is
`0x0000aaaaaaaa0820`. You can try to put that address in the right bytes of the input
argument so that the return address while on the stack in function `f` is
overwritten with this value.

You saw previously that the return address will be overwritten with bytes 16 till 23 of the string argument to `redirect1`.

{{% notice "Exercise 4" %}}

Create a string that results in overwriting the return address in function `f`
with the value `0x0000aaaaaaaa0820`.

The answer to this exercise can be found in the [Answers section]({{< relref "exercise-answers#answer-to-exercise-4" >}}).

1. You can use the syntax `$'\xAB'` to easily construct strings on the command
   line that contain specific byte values, written as a hexadecimal value.

   For example:
   ```bash { command_line="root@7a8fb34f810e:/armlearningpaths|2-30" }
   echo $'hello \xaa' | od -t x1 -c
   0000000  68  65  6c  6c  6f  20  aa  0a
             h   e   l   l   o     252  \n
   0000010
   ```

2. You will also need to take into account that you are working on a
   little-endian target.
