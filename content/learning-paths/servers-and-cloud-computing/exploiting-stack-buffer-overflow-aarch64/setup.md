You will run all of the experiments in this learning path within a Docker container.
Perform the following steps to build the docker container.

Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content on your AArch64 linux machine:

```
FROM ubuntu:22.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
 clang gdb \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# disable ASLR - needed for some of the experiments
RUN echo "kernel.randomize_va_space = 0" > /etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-aslr.conf
```
{{% notice Note %}}
The last line in the `Dockerfile` disables the on-by-default
[ASLR mitigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization)
Without this change, it will block the exploit you are going to build.

Also, you will use gdb in the docker image, which only works when the docker image and the host computer use the same instruction set.
{{% /notice %}}

Now, build a docker image from the description in the `Dockerfile`, by running
the following command:

```bash
docker build --tag armlearningpath/bufferoverflow:v1.0 .
```

This command builds the AArch64 linux docker container in which you will run
the experiments.

Start the docker environment with the following command:

```bash
docker run -i -t -v $(pwd):/armlearningpaths -w /armlearningpaths --security-opt seccomp=unconfined armlearningpath/bufferoverflow:v1.0
```

This will run AArch64 Ubuntu 22.04 in Docker. You will see the following prompt:

```output
root@7a8fb34f810e:/armlearningpaths#
```

The directory `/armlearningpaths` maps to the current directory where you ran
the `docker run` command. All changes you make in this directory will persist
outside the docker container.
