title: Learn about the impact of stack buffer overflows

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers interested in understanding how memory vulnerability-based exploits work on AArch64 and how to defend against them.


learning_objectives: 
   - Analyze the stack frame layout to derive which
     field in user input overwrites the return address stored on the stack.
   - Build a basic end-to-end exploit by changing the return address to an
     attacker-controlled value.

prerequisites:
    - An Arm computer running linux with [Docker](/install-guides/docker/) installed.
    - Some familiarity with reading and writing basic C code and AArch64 assembly code.
    - Some familiarity with running linux command line commands.
    - Some familiarity with using a gdb debugger.
