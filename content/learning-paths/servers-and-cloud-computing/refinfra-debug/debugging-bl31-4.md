## Debugging BL31 
Setting a breakpoint for BL1 was simple enough, but how do we set a breakpoint for BL31?

In the tabs panel at the bottom, click the plus (`+`) and add other views. Here are multiple other views available such as Register View, Memory View, and others.

For this example, we are only interested in the **Functions** view.

![add functions alt-text#center](images/add_functions.png "Figure 1. Add functions tab")

Search for ``bl31_entrypoint`` using the flashlight icon and set a breakpoint. Press continue. 

![bl31 breakpoint 1 alt-text#center](images/bl31_breakpoint-1.png "Figure 2. BL31 breakpoint 1")

Observe the application processor console output. TF-A will proceed from BL1 to BL2 to BL31.

After reaching BL31, NeoverseN2 Core 0 stops on the breakpoint.
