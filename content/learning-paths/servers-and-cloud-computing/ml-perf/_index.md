title: Measure Machine Learning Inference Performance on Arm servers

minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested
  in benchmarking machine learning workloads on Arm servers.


learning_objectives:
- Install and run TensorFlow on your Arm-based cloud server.
- Use MLPerf Inference benchmark suite, an open-sourced benchmark from MLCommons to
  test ML performance on your Arm server.

prerequisites:
- An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from an appropriate
  cloud service provider or an on-premise Arm server.
