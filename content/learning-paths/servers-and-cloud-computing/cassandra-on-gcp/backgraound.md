## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## Cassandra

Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers without a single point of failure.

It provides high availability, fault tolerance, and linear scalability, making it ideal for real-time big data applications and high-throughput workloads.

Cassandra is widely used for time-series data, IoT applications, recommendation engines, and large-scale cloud services. Learn more from the [Cassandra official website](https://cassandra.apache.org/) and its [documentation](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/).
