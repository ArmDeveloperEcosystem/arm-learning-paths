## Explore Google Axion C4A Arm instances

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Google's custom Axion CPU, based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. These virtual machines deliver strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

To learn more about Google Axion, see the Google blog [Introducing Google Axion Processors, our new Arm-based CPUs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu).

## Explore Cassandra

Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers without a single point of failure.

It provides high availability, fault tolerance, and linear scalability, making it ideal for real-time big data applications and high-throughput workloads.

Cassandra is widely used for time-series data, IoT applications, recommendation engines, and large-scale cloud services. To learn, see the [Cassandra website](https://cassandra.apache.org/) and the [Cassandra documentation](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/).
