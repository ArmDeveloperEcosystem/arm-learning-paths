## Cassandra Benchmarking by Cassandra-Stress
Cassandra benchmarking can be performed using the built-in `cassandra-stress` tool, which helps measure database performance under different workloads such as write, read, and mixed operations.

### Steps for Cassandra Benchmarking with Cassandra-Stress
**Verify cassandra-stress Installation:**

Cassandra comes with a built-in tool called **cassandra-stress** that is used for testing performance. It is usually located in the `tools/bin/` folder of your Cassandra installation. 

```console
ls ~/cassandra/tools/bin | grep cassandra-stress
```
If you see cassandra-stress in the list, it means the tool is installed and ready to use.

**Run the version check:**

To make sure the tool works correctly, check its help options.

```console
~/cassandra/tools/bin/cassandra-stress help
```
You should see output similar to the following:

```output
Usage:      cassandra-stress <command> [options]
Help usage: cassandra-stress help <command>

---Commands---
read                 : Multiple concurrent reads - the cluster must first be populated by a write test
write                : Multiple concurrent writes against the cluster
mixed                : Interleaving of any basic commands, with configurable ratio and distribution - the cluster must first be populated by a write test
counter_write        : Multiple concurrent updates of counters.
counter_read         : Multiple concurrent reads of counters. The cluster must first be populated by a counterwrite test.
user                 : Interleaving of user provided queries, with configurable ratio and distribution
help                 : Print help for a command or option
print                : Inspect the output of a distribution definition
version              : Print the version of cassandra stress
```
If the tool is working, you will see a list of commands and options that you can use to run benchmarks.
This confirms that your setup is correct and you’re ready to start testing Cassandra’s performance.

### Basic Write Test
Insert 10,000 rows with 50 concurrent threads using `cassandra-stress`:

```console
~/cassandra/tools/bin/cassandra-stress write n=10000 -rate threads=50
```
- **write** → Performs only write operations on the Cassandra cluster.  
- **n=10000** → Specifies the number of rows to insert during the benchmark test.  
- **-rate threads=50** → Sets the number of concurrent worker threads simulating multiple clients writing to the cluster. 

You should see output similar to the following:

### Read Test
The following command runs a **read benchmark** on your Cassandra database using `cassandra-stress`. It simulates multiple clients reading from the cluster at the same time and records performance metrics such as **throughput** and **latency**.

```console
~/cassandra/tools/bin/cassandra-stress read n=10000 -rate threads=50
```
You should see output similar to the following:
```output

## Benchmark Results Table Explained:

- **Op rate (operations per second):** The number of read operations Cassandra successfully executed per second.  
- **Partition rate:** Number of partitions read per second. Since this is a read test, the partition rate equals the op rate.  
- **Row rate:** Number of rows read per second. Again, for this test it equals the op rate.  
- **Latency mean:** The average time taken for each read request to complete.  
- **Latency median:** The 50th percentile latency — half of the operations completed faster than this time.  
- **Latency max:** The slowest single read request during the test.  
- **Total partitions:** The total number of partitions read during the test.  
- **Total errors:** Number of failed read operations.  
- **GC metrics (Garbage Collection):** Shows whether JVM garbage collection paused Cassandra during the test.  
- **Total operation time:** The total wall-clock time taken to run the benchmark.

### Cassandra performance benchmarking notes
When examining the benchmark results, you will notice that on the Google Axion C4A Arm-based instances:

- The write operations achieved a high throughput of **10,690 op/s**, while read operations reached **4,962 op/s** on the `c4a-standard-4` Arm64 VM.  
- Latency for writes was very low (mean: **3.7 ms**) compared to reads (mean: **6.3 ms**), indicating fast write processing on this Arm64 VM.  
- The 95th and 99th percentile latencies show consistent performance, with writes significantly faster than reads.  
- There were no errors or GC overhead, confirming stable and reliable benchmarking results.  

Overall, the Arm64 VM provides efficient and predictable performance, making it suitable for high-throughput Cassandra workloads.
