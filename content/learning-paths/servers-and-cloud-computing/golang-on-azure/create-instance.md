## Prerequisites and setup

There are several common ways to create an Arm-based Cobalt 100 virtual machine, and you can choose the method that best fits your workflow or requirements:

- The Azure Portal
- The Azure CLI
- An infrastructure as code (IaC) tool

In this section, you will launch the Azure Portal to create a virtual machine with the Arm-based Azure Cobalt 100 processor.

This Learning Path focuses on general-purpose virtual machines in the Dpsv6 series. For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure guide for the Dpsv6 size series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/dpsv6-series).

While the steps to create this instance are included here for convenience, you can also refer to the [Deploy a Cobalt 100 virtual machine on Azure Learning Path](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/cobalt/).

## Create an Arm-based Azure virtual machine

Creating a virtual machine on Azure Cobalt 100 follows the standard Azure VM flow, which typically involves specifying basic settings, selecting an operating system image, configuring authentication, and setting up networking and security options. 

For more information, see the [Azure VM creation documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal).

To create a VM using the Azure Portal, follow these steps:

- In the Azure portal, go to **Virtual machines**.

- Select **Create**, then choose **Virtual machine** from the drop-down.

- On the **Basics** tab, enter **Virtual machine name** and **Region**.

- Under **Image**, choose your OS (for example, *Ubuntu Pro 24.04 LTS*) and set **Architecture** to **Arm64**.

- In **Size**, select **See all sizes**, choose the **Dpsv6** series, then select **D4ps_v6**.

- Under **Authentication type**, choose **SSH public key**. Azure can generate a key pair and store it for future use. For **SSH key type**, **ED25519** is recommended (RSA is also supported).

- Enter the **Administrator username**.

- If generating a new key, select **Generate new key pair**, choose **ED25519** (or **RSA**), and provide a **Key pair name**.

- In **Inbound port rules**, select **HTTP (80)** and **SSH (22)**.

- Select **Review + create** and review your configuration. It should look similar to:

When youâ€™re ready, select **Create**, then **Download private key and create resources**.

Your virtual machine should be ready and running within no time. You can SSH into the virtual machine using the private key, along with the Public IP details.
