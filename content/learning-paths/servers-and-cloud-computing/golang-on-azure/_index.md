minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers, DevOps engineers, and cloud architects looking to migrate their Golang (Go) applications from x86_64 to high-performance Arm-based Azure Cobalt 100 virtual machines for improved cost efficiency and performance.

learning_objectives: 
    - Provision an Azure Arm64 virtual machine using the Azure portal, with Ubuntu Pro 24.04 LTS as the base image
    - Deploy Golang on an Arm64-based virtual machine running Ubuntu Pro 24.04 LTS
    - Perform Golang baseline testing and benchmarking on both x86_64 and Arm64 virtual machines

prerequisites:
    - A [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account with access to Azure Cobalt 100 Arm-based instances (Dpsv6-series)
    - Basic familiarity with the [Go programming language](https://go.dev/) and cloud deployment practices
    - Understanding of Linux command line and virtual machine management
