## Before you begin

You will need 7 physical Arm machines or cloud instances with Ubuntu/Debian installed. 
Make sure ports 8080, 2888, 3888, 2181 and 9092 are open in the security group of the IP addresses for these machines.

## Introduction to Kafka

Kafka is an event streaming platform. It is a distributed system consisting of servers and clients that communicate via a high-performance TCP network protocol. It can be deployed on bare-metal hardware, virtual machines, and containers in on-premise as well as cloud environments. The [Getting Started Guide](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#gettingStarted) is a great resource to learn more about Kafka.

## Introduction to Zookeeper

Zookeeper is an open sourced project that provides a centralized service for maintenance of configuration information, naming and group services. It is used by a cluster or a group of nodes to share data. Kafka is built to use Zookeeper to coordinate tasks.

## Setup

In this Learning Path, you will deploy 3 of the Arm machines as Kafka nodes, 3 machines as Zookeeper nodes and one machine as a client node. A diagram of the setup is shown below. For a simpler single node setup, follow the Kafka [quick start guide](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart).

# Install Java:

Install Java on all 7 nodes.
