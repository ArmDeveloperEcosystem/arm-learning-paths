## Cobalt 100 processor

Azure's Cobalt 100 is built on Microsoft's first-generation, in-house Arm-based processor. Designed entirely by Microsoft and based on Arm's Neoverse N2 architecture, this 64-bit CPU delivers improved performance and energy efficiency across a broad spectrum of cloud-native, scale-out Linux workloads, including web and application servers, data analytics, open-source databases, caching systems, and related technologies. Running at 3.4 GHz, the Cobalt 100 processor allocates a dedicated physical core for each vCPU, ensuring consistent and predictable performance. 

For more information about Cobalt 100, see [Announcing the preview of new Azure virtual machines based on the Azure Cobalt 100 processor](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurecompute/announcing-the-preview-of-new-azure-vms-based-on-the-azure-cobalt-100-processor/4146353).

## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Google’s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series offers a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines, leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.
