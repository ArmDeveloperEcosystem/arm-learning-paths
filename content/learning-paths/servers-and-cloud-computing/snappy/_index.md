title: Measure performance of compression libraries on Arm servers

minutes_to_complete: 10

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers using compression
  libraries on Arm servers.


learning_objectives:
- Install and run lzbench with snappy and zstd
- Measure compression library performance running on 64-bit Arm AWS EC2 instance

prerequisites:
- An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from an appropriate
  cloud service provider.
