who_is_this_for: >
  Developers who wish to run a Linux system (optionally using a custom kernel and
  a C library) on an Arm Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) model. For example, this
  guide might be useful if you want to test patches for the Linux kernel or Glibc.

learning_objectives: 
  - Build the Linux kernel.
  - Install the Shrinkwrap tool, build firmware for the FVP and run it.
  - Configure and boot a Linux system on the FVP.
  - Configure guest OS to make running Glibc tests easier.
  - Build Glibc and run tests on the system running on the FVP.

prerequisites:
  - An AArch64 or x86 host running a Linux system.
  - GCC cross toolchain for the `aarch64-none-linux-gnu` target.
  - Docker.
  - Git to checkout sources.
  - Make to build the tools.
  - Bash for your shell.
  - Python 3.x and `pip` to create a Python virtual environment.
  - Common tools like `wget`, `unxz`, `truncate`.
