## Root user
Although you can run Process Watch as a non-root user, it requires modifications made by root, which makes your system less secure. It is recommended that Process Watch is instead run by root.

To enable non-root users to run Process Watch, you need to run the following as root:
```bash
sudo setcap CAP_PERFMON,CAP_BPF=+ep ./processwatch
sudo sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1
sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=0
```

## Run Process Watch
The Process Watch tool accepts a number of command-line arguments. You can view these by running:
```bash
sudo ./processwatch -h
```
The output should look like:
```output
usage: processwatch [options]

options:
  -h          Displays this help message.
  -v          Displays the version.
  -i <int>    Prints results every <int> seconds.
  -n <num>    Prints results for <num> intervals.
  -c          Prints all results in CSV format to stdout.
  -p <pid>    Only profiles <pid>.
  -m          Displays instruction mnemonics, instead of categories.
  -s <samp>   Profiles instructions with a sampling period of <samp>.
  -f <filter> Can be used multiple times. Defines filters for columns. Defaults to 'FPARMv8', 'NEON', 'SVE' and 'SVE2'.
  -l          Prints all available categories, or mnemonics if -m is specified.
  -d          Prints only debug information.
  ```


By default, Process Watch:
 * Prints results every two seconds.
 * Prints results until the tool is killed (via Ctrl+c).
 * Prints all results in a table format on `stdout`.
 * Profiles all running processes.
 * Displays counts for the default filters, which are 'FPARMv8', 'NEON', 'SVE', and 'SVE2'.
 * Sets the sample period to every 10000 events.

## Default Process Watch output
You can run Process Watch with no arguments:

```output
sudo ./processwatch
```

The output should look like:

Every two seconds, the next set of samples are appended to the bottom of the output.

Now use Ctrl+c to terminate the run.
