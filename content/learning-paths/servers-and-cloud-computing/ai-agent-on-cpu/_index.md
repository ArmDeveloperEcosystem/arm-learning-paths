title: Deploy an AI Agent on Arm with llama.cpp and llama-cpp-agent using KleidiAI

minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers and ML engineers looking to deploy an optimized AI agent application.

learning_objectives:
    - Set up llama-cpp-python optimized for Arm servers.
    - Run optimized Large Language Models (LLMs).
    - Create custom functions for LLMs.
    - Deploy optimized AI agents for applications.

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider or an on-premise Arm server.
    - Basic understanding of Python and prompt engineering.
    - Understanding of LLM fundamentals.
