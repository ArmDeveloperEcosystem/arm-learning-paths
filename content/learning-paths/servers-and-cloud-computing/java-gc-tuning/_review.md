        question: >
            What is the purpose of Garbage Collection?
        answers:
            - To manage memory by automatically reclaiming unused objects.
            - To manually manage memory allocation.
        correct_answer: 1                    
        explanation: >
            Garbage Collection is used to manage memory by automatically reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use, to prevent memory leaks and optimize memory usage.

        question: >
            Which JVM flag can you use to enable detailed garbage collection logging?
        answers:
            - -XX:+UseG1GC.
            - -XX:+PrintGCDetails.
        correct_answer: 2                    
        explanation: >
            The flag -XX:+PrintGCDetails enables detailed logging of garbage collection events, which helps in monitoring and tuning the GC performance.

        question: >
            Which Garbage Collector is best suited for applications requiring very low latency in a heavily multi-threaded application?
        answers:
            - Serial GC.
            - ZGC.
        correct_answer: 2                    
        explanation: >
            ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) is designed for applications requiring very low latency, as it aims to keep pause times below 10 milliseconds even for large heaps.
