minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for Java developers aiming to optimize application performance on Arm-based servers, especially those migrating applications from x86-based to Arm-based instances. 

learning_objectives: 
    - Describe the key differences between individual Java Garbage Collectors (GCs).
    - Monitor and interpret Garbage Collector performance metrics.
    - Adjust core parameters to optimize performance for your specific workload.

prerequisites:
    - An Arm-based instance from a cloud service provider, or an on-premise Arm server.
    - Basic understanding of Java.
    - An [installation of Java](/install-guides/java/) on your machine.
