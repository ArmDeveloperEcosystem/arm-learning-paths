    - Use a GitHub project and AWS CodeBuild to automate Docker image creation
    - Pull and run the created Docker images on any Arm computer with Docker installed

prerequisites:
    - An [AWS account](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/aws/) for accessing AWS cloud services.
    - An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider or any Arm server, laptop, or single-board computer running [Docker](/install-guides/docker/) used to run the created images
