title: Accelerate Bitmap Scanning with NEON and SVE Instructions on Arm servers

minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for database developers, performance engineers, and anyone interested in optimizing data processing workloads on Arm-based cloud instances.


learning_objectives:
  - Understand bitmap scanning operations in database systems
  - Implement bitmap scanning with scalar, NEON, and SVE instructions
  - Compare performance between different implementations
  - Measure performance improvements on Graviton4 instances

prerequisites:
- An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from an appropriate
  cloud service provider.
