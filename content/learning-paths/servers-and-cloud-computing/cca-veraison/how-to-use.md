## Highlights

Some highlights of using this Learning Path are the following:

* Practical, hands-on experience with the data formats and workflows associated with attestation, which in turn will help to provide you with a joined-up understanding of the many separate documents and specifications that exist on this topic.

* An opportunity to learn about the common concepts in attestation, supported by code examples as a demonstration. 

* In advance of the practical sections, a chance to read theoretical overviews of both CCA Attestation and Veraison to help you grasp the basic concepts before progressing to the practical sections.
