## Highlights

These are some highlights of using this Learning Path:

* Code examples that demonstrate some of the common concepts in attestation.

* Practical, hands-on experience with the data formats and workflows associated with attestation, which help to provide you with a joined-up understanding of the many separate documents and specifications that exist on this topic.

* Theoretical overviews of both CCA Attestation and Veraison to help you grasp the basic concepts before progressing to the practical sections.
