## Cobalt 100 Arm-based processor

Azure’s Cobalt 100 is built on Microsoft's first-generation, in-house Arm-based processor: the Cobalt 100. Designed entirely by Microsoft and based on Arm’s Neoverse N2 architecture, this 64-bit CPU delivers improved performance and energy efficiency across a broad spectrum of cloud-native, scale-out Linux workloads. These include web and application servers, data analytics, open-source databases, caching systems, and more. Running at 3.4 GHz, the Cobalt 100 processor allocates a dedicated physical core for each vCPU, ensuring consistent and predictable performance. 

To learn more about Cobalt 100, refer to the blog [Announcing the preview of new Azure virtual machine based on the Azure Cobalt 100 processor](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurecompute/announcing-the-preview-of-new-azure-vms-based-on-the-azure-cobalt-100-processor/4146353).

## Java  
Java is a high-performance, open-source, object-oriented programming language and runtime environment widely used for building scalable, reliable, and secure applications.  

It enables developers to write code once and run it anywhere, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which abstracts away hardware and operating system differences. Java applications are compiled into bytecode, which the JVM executes, providing portability and performance across platforms.  

Java is extensively used in enterprise systems, cloud-native applications, Android development, big data processing, and high-performance computing. Learn more from the [OpenJDK official website](https://openjdk.org/) and its [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/).
