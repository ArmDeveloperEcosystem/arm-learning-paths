## Azure Cobalt 100 Arm-based CPU for Linux workloads

Azure Cobalt 100 is Microsoft’s first‑generation, in‑house Arm‑based CPU built on Arm Neoverse N2. It is designed for predictable performance and energy efficiency across common Linux workloads such as web and application servers, analytics, open‑source databases, and caching systems. Each vCPU maps to a dedicated physical core and runs up to **3.4 GHz**, helping deliver consistent latency under load.

## Running Java on Azure Cobalt 100 Arm-based VMs

Java is a mature, object‑oriented language and runtime used to build scalable, secure applications. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes platform‑independent bytecode, enabling *write once, run anywhere* portability across architectures, including Arm64 (AArch64). On Azure Cobalt 100, Java services benefit from modern JIT compilers and efficient multithreading for steady throughput and low tail latency.
