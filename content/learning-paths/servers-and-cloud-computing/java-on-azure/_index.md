who_is_this_for: This Learning Path introduces Java deployment on Microsoft Azure Cobalt 100 (Arm-based) virtual machines. It is designed for developers migrating Java applications from x86_64 to Arm with minimal or no changes.

learning_objectives: 
    - Provision an Azure Arm64 virtual machine using Azure console, with Ubuntu Pro 24.04 LTS as the base image.
    - Deploy Java on the Ubuntu Pro virtual machine.
    - Perform Java baseline testing and benchmarking on both x86_64 and Arm64 virtual machines.

prerequisites:
    - A [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account with access to Cobalt 100 based instances (Dpsv6). 
    - Basic understanding of Linux command line.  
    - Familiarity with the [Java platform](https://openjdk.org/) and deployment practices on Arm64 platforms.
