## Connect over SSH and test the open port

On the **Overview** page of the VM, copy the **Public IP address**. Open a terminal on your local machine, and SSH to the VM (replace *azureuser* if you chose a different admin username):

```bash
ssh -i [path to your pem file] azureuser@[public IP]
```

Replace `[public IP]` with your VM's public IP address, and `[path to your pem file]` with the path to your SSH private key file.

When prompted, confirm the connection to add the VM to your *known_hosts* file.

### Start a temporary HTTP server

If you don't already have an application listening on TCP 8080, you can start one temporarily:

```bash
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install -y python3
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Leave this terminal open â€“ the server runs in the foreground.

### Test from your local machine

In a second local terminal run `curl` to confirm that you can reach the server through the NSG rule you created:

```bash
curl http://[public IP]:8080
```

Replace `[public IP]` with your VM's public IP address.

You should see an HTML directory listing (or your application response). A successful response confirms that TCP port 8080 is open and the VM is reachable from the public internet.

To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C`.

You now have an Arm-based Cobalt 100 VM with port 8080 open and ready to receive external traffic. You can use it to run any test server or deploy your own application.
