title: Optimize Arm applications and shared libraries with BOLT

draft: true
cascade:
    draft: true

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: Performance engineers and software developers working on Arm platforms who want to optimize both application binaries and shared libraries using BOLT.

learning_objectives: 
    - Instrument and optimize application binaries for individual workload features using BOLT.
    - Collect separate BOLT profiles and merge them for comprehensive code coverage.
    - Optimize shared libraries independently.
    - Integrate optimized shared libraries into applications.
    - Evaluate and compare application and library performance across baseline, isolated, and merged optimization scenarios.

prerequisites:
    - An Arm based system running Linux with [BOLT](/install-guides/bolt/) and [Linux Perf](/install-guides/perf/) installed.
