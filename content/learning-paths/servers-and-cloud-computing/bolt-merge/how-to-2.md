title: BOLT Optimization - First feature
weight: 3

### FIXED, DO NOT MODIFY
layout: learningpathall
---

In this step, you will instrument an application binary (such as `mysqld`) with BOLT to collect runtime profile data for a specific feature â€” for example, a **read-only workload**.

The collected profile will later be merged with others and used to optimize the application's code layout.

### Step 1: Build or obtain the uninstrumented binary

Make sure your application binary is:

- Built from source (e.g., `mysqld`)
- Unstripped, with symbol information available
- Compiled with frame pointers enabled (`-fno-omit-frame-pointer`)

You can verify this with:

```bash
readelf -s /path/to/mysqld | grep main
```

If the symbols are missing, rebuild the binary with debug info and no stripping.

---

### Step 2: Instrument the binary with BOLT

Use `llvm-bolt` to create an instrumented version of the binary:

```bash
llvm-bolt /path/to/mysqld \\
  -instrument \\
  -o /path/to/mysqld.instrumented \\
  --instrumentation-file=/path/to/profile-readonly.fdata \\
  --instrumentation-sleep-time=5 \\
  --instrumentation-no-counters-clear \\
  --instrumentation-wait-forks
```

### Explanation of key options

- `-instrument`: Enables profile generation instrumentation
- `--instrumentation-file`: Path where the profile output will be saved
- `--instrumentation-wait-forks`: Ensures the instrumentation continues through forks (important for daemon processes)

---

### Step 3: Run the instrumented binary under a feature-specific workload

Use a workload generator to stress the binary in a feature-specific way. For example, to simulate **read-only traffic** with sysbench:

```bash
taskset -c 9 ./src/sysbench \\
  --db-driver=mysql \\
  --mysql-host=127.0.0.1 \\
  --mysql-db=bench \\
  --mysql-user=bench \\
  --mysql-password=bench \\
  --mysql-port=3306 \\
  --tables=8 \\
  --table-size=10000 \\
  --threads=1 \\
  src/lua/oltp_read_only.lua run
```

> Adjust this command as needed for your workload and CPU/core binding.

The `.fdata` file defined in `--instrumentation-file` will be populated with runtime execution data.

---

### Step 4: Verify the profile was created

After running the workload:

```bash
ls -lh /path/to/profile-readonly.fdata
```

You should see a non-empty file. This file will later be merged with other profiles (e.g., for write-only traffic) to generate a complete merged profile.
