## Overview

This section compares the performance of baseline binaries with BOLT-optimized versions. It highlights the impact of merged profile optimizations and shared library enhancements on overall system throughput and latency.

All tests used Sysbench with the flags `--time=0 --events=10000`. This configuration ensures that each test completes exactly 10,000 requests per thread, delivering consistent workload runtimes  across runs.

{{% notice Note %}}
All Sysbench and .fdata file paths, as well as taskset usage, should match the conventions in previous steps: use Sysbench from PATH (no src/), use /usr/share/sysbench/ for Lua scripts, and use $HOME-based paths for all .fdata and library files. On an 8-core system, use taskset -c 7 for Sysbench and avoid contention with mysqld.

## Key metrics to analyze

- **TPS (transactions per second)** – higher is better  
- **QPS (queries per second)** – higher is better  
- **Latency (average and 95th percentile)** – lower is better

## Conclusion

- BOLT-optimized binaries clearly outperform baseline versions by improving instruction cache usage and shortening execution paths.
- Merging feature-specific profiles does not negatively affect performance. Instead, they allow better tuning for varied real-world workloads by capturing a broader set of runtime behaviors.
- External library optimizations (for example, `libssl` and `libcrypto`) provide smaller incremental gains, delivering a fully-optimized execution environment.
