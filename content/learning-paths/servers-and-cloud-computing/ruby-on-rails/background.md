## Learn about Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Google's custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

To learn more about Google Axion, refer to the [Introducing Google Axion Processors, our new Arm-based CPUs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu) blog.

## Learn about Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails (Rails) is an open-source, server-side web application framework written in Ruby.  

It allows developers to build database-backed web applications quickly using convention over configuration, MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, and built-in tools for routing, database migrations, and view rendering.  

Rails is widely used for web applications, APIs, and full-stack development projects. Learn more from the [Ruby on Rails official website](https://rubyonrails.org/) and the [Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/).

## What you've accomplished and what's next

Understanding these technologies sets the stage for deploying and optimizing Rails workloads on Arm-based cloud infrastructure. Now that you have the foundational context, you’re ready to set up your development environment and begin working with Ruby on Rails on Google Axion C4A instances.

In the next section, you’ll install the required tools and configure your environment to run Rails applications on Arm-based Google Cloud VMs. This hands-on setup will help you build, test, and deploy Rails projects efficiently on Arm architecture.
