## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails (Rails) is an open-source, server-side web application framework written in Ruby.  

It allows developers to build database-backed web applications quickly using convention over configuration, MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, and built-in tools for routing, database migrations, and view rendering.  

Rails is widely used for web applications, APIs, and full-stack development projects. Learn more from the [Ruby on Rails official website](https://rubyonrails.org/) and its [guides and documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/).
