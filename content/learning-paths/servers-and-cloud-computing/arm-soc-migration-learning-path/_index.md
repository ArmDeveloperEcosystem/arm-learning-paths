minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This learning path is for developers migrating applications between Arm platforms using Kiro's ARM SoC Migration Power. Learn the workflow through a practical example migrating code from the cloud to the edge - from AWS Graviton to Raspberry Pi 5.

learning_objectives:
    - Install and configure Kiro's ARM SoC Migration Power 
    - Understand the migration workflow applicable to various Arm platforms
    - Use AI-guided migration to identify platform-specific code
    - Create Hardware Abstraction Layers with power assistance
    - Validate migrations with automated analysis

prerequisites:
    - Access to source and target Arm platforms (example uses AWS Graviton and Raspberry Pi 5)
    - Basic understanding of C programming
    - Familiarity with embedded systems or cloud computing concepts
