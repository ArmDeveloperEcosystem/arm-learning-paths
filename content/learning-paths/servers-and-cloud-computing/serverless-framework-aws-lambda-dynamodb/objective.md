### What is the Serverless Framework?

The Serverless Framework is an open-source toolkit that enables developers to build and deploy applications on cloud infrastructure without managing server operations. By abstracting away the underlying server management, it allows for greater focus on writing code and developing features, enhancing productivity and efficiency. The framework supports multiple cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, providing a versatile and scalable solution for modern application development. With its powerful plug-ins and community support, the Serverless Framework simplifies complex deployment processes, promotes best practices, and facilitates rapid iteration, making it an essential tool in the DevOps landscape.

In the previous [Learning Path](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/serverless-framework-aws-intro/), you learned how to set up the Serverless Framework for AWS and deploy a simple AWS Lambda function. For more tutorials about running IoT applications by manually creating various AWS resources, please review the following learning paths:
1. [Use Amazon DynamoDB for your IoT applications running on Arm64](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/win_aws_iot_dynamodb).
2. [Use AWS Lambda for IoT applications running on Arm64](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/win_aws_iot_lambda).
3. [Integrate AWS Lambda with DynamoDB for IoT applications running on Windows on Arm](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/win_aws_iot_lambda_dynamodb).

While manual resource provisioning has its benefits, it can become increasingly problematic as you start deploying your applications to the cloud. As your solutions grow and become more complex, the challenges associated with manual provisioning escalate. This is where the Serverless Framework comes into play, offering a streamlined and efficient way to manage your cloud resources.

In this learning path, you will learn how to automatically deploy a multi-resource serverless solution to AWS. By leveraging the Serverless Framework, you can simplify the deployment process, enhance scalability, and reduce the operational overhead associated with managing cloud infrastructure manually. Specifically, you will create a solution composed of the DynamoDB table and the AWS Lambda function. The latter will consume the data from the table. The function will calculate the average of numerical values in the selected column. This is similar to what you learned in this [Learning Path](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/win_aws_iot_lambda_dynamodb).
