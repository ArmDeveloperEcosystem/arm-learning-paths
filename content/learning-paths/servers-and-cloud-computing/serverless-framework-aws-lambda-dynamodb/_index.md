title: Deploy and integrate AWS Lambda with DynamoDB using the Serverless Framework

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This learning path is for software developers interested in learning how to deploy serverless applications using the Serverless Framework and Amazon Web Services. It automates several manual deployment steps that developers typically need to perform when deploying microservice-based or IoT applications.

learning_objectives: 
    - Create a multi-resource Serverless Framework solution.
    - Automate deployment of AWS Lambda function consuming data from DynamoDB.    

prerequisites:
    - A Windows on Arm computer such as the Lenovo Thinkpad X13s running Windows 11 or a Windows on Arm [virtual machine](/learning-paths/cross-platform/woa_azure/).   
    - Any code editor. [Visual Studio Code for Arm64](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win32arm64user) is suitable.
    - Completion of [Deploy AWS services using the Serverless Framework](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/serverless-framework-aws-intro/).
