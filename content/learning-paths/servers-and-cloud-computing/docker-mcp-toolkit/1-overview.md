## Why migrate to Arm?

Arm-based cloud instances are now widely available across major providers, including AWS Graviton, Azure Cobalt, and Google Cloud Axion. These platforms deliver strong performance-per-watt characteristics and, for many workloads, measurable cost savings compared to equivalent x86 instances.

For containerized applications written in portable, architecture-neutral code, migration can be straightforward: rebuild the container for `linux/arm64` and redeploy.

However, many performance-sensitive applications are not architecture-neutral. They may include:

- x86-specific compiler flags (for example `-mavx2`)
- Hand-optimized assembly
- AVX2 intrinsics mapped directly to Intel vector instructions
- Assumptions about register width, alignment, or instruction semantics

In these cases, rebuilding the container is not enough. The source code itself must be adapted for Arm.

## Considerations when migrating from x86 to Arm

When architecture-specific optimizations are present, migration may involve:

- Identifying x86-specific intrinsics or assembly
- Updating compiler flags and build configurations
- Mapping AVX2 operations to appropriate NEON equivalents
- Rewriting vectorized code and adjusting loop structures.
- Updating Dockerfiles, base images, and compiler flags.
- Validating correctness and performance on Arm systems

These steps are well understood, but they can require careful review across code, build scripts, and container configurations.

## What the Docker MCP Toolkit provides

The Docker MCP Toolkit is a management interface in Docker Desktop that lets you discover, configure, and run containerized MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It connects these servers to AI coding assistants through a unified gateway.

For Arm migration, three MCP servers work together:

- **Arm MCP Server**:
  Provides migration-focused tools, including:
  - `migrate_ease_scan` for detecting x86-specific code and compiler flags
  - `check_image` and `skopeo` for verifying container architecture support
  - `knowledge_base_search` for a knowledge base of learning resources, Arm intrinsics, and software version compatibility
  - `mca` for microarchitectural performance analysis
  
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Enables Git repository operations including creating pull requests, managing branches, and committing changes.
- 
- **Sequential Thinking MCP Server**: Helps the AI assistant break down complex migration decisions into logical steps.

## How AI-assisted migration works

When connected to the Docker MCP Toolkit, an AI coding assistant like GitHub Copilot can coordinate a structured migration workflow:

1. Verify whether container base images support `linux/arm64` using `check_image` or `skopeo`.
2. Scan the codebase with `migrate_ease_scan` to identify AVX2 intrinsics, x86-specific flags, and other portability considerations.
3. Use `knowledge_base_search` to find appropriate Arm SIMD equivalents for every x86 intrinsic.
4. Refactor the code with architecture-specific accuracy.
5. Update Dockerfiles and build configurations for Arm comptibility. 
6. Create a pull request with the proposed changes using the GitHub MCP Server.

## What you will build in this Learning Path

In this Learning Path, you will migrate a real-world legacy application - a matrix multiplication benchmark written with AVX2 intrinsics for x86 - to Arm64 using GitHub Copilot and Docker MCP Toolkit.

The demo repository is available at [github.com/JoeStech/docker-blog-arm-migration](https://github.com/JoeStech/docker-blog-arm-migration).

You will:

1. Set up Docker MCP Toolkit with the Arm, GitHub, and Sequential Thinking MCP servers.
2. Connect VS Code with GitHub Copilot to the MCP Gateway.
3. Analyze the x86-specific portions of the codebase.
4. Use AI-assisted MCP workflows to update intrinsics and container configuration.
5. Review and validate the pull request generated by the AI agent.

In the next section, you will install and configure the Docker MCP Toolkit.
