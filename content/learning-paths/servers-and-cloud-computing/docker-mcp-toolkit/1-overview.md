## Why migrate to Arm?

Arm-based cloud instances are now widely available across major providers, including AWS Graviton, Azure Cobalt, and Google Cloud Axion. These platforms deliver strong performance-per-watt characteristics and, for many workloads, measurable cost savings compared to equivalent x86 instances.

For containerized applications written in portable, architecture-neutral code, migration can be straightforward: rebuild the container for `linux/arm64` and redeploy.

However, many performance-sensitive applications are not architecture-neutral. They may include:

- x86-specific compiler flags (for example `-mavx2`)
- Hand-optimized assembly
- AVX2 intrinsics mapped directly to Intel vector instructions
- Assumptions about register width, alignment, or instruction semantics

In these cases, rebuilding the container is not enough. The source code itself must be adapted for Arm.

## Considerations when migrating from x86 to Arm

When architecture-specific optimizations are present, migration may involve:

- Identifying x86-specific intrinsics or assembly
- Updating compiler flags and build configurations
- Mapping AVX2 operations to appropriate NEON equivalents
- Rewriting vectorized code and adjusting loop structures
- Updating Dockerfiles, base images, and compiler flags
- Validating correctness and performance on Arm systems

These steps are well understood, but they can require careful review across code, build scripts, and container configurations.

## What the Docker MCP Toolkit provides

The Docker MCP Toolkit is a management interface in Docker Desktop that lets you discover, configure, and run containerized MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It connects these servers to AI coding assistants through a unified gateway.

Each MCP server provides specialized capabilities that work together to support the migration workflow. For Arm migration, three MCP servers work together:

- **Arm MCP Server**:
  Provides migration-focused tools, including:
  - `migrate_ease_scan` for detecting x86-specific code and compiler flags
  - `check_image` and `skopeo` for verifying container architecture support
  - `knowledge_base_search` for a knowledge base of learning resources, Arm intrinsics, and software version compatibility
  - `mca` for microarchitectural performance analysis
  
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Enables Git repository operations including creating pull requests, managing branches, and committing changes.
- 
- **Sequential Thinking MCP Server**: Helps the AI assistant break down complex migration decisions into logical steps.

## How AI-assisted migration works

When connected to the Docker MCP Toolkit, an AI coding assistant like GitHub Copilot can coordinate a structured migration workflow:

- Verify whether container base images support `linux/arm64` using `check_image` or `skopeo`
- Scan the codebase with `migrate_ease_scan` to identify AVX2 intrinsics, x86-specific flags, and other portability considerations
- Use `knowledge_base_search` to find appropriate Arm SIMD equivalents for every x86 intrinsic
- Refactor the code with architecture-specific accuracy
- Update Dockerfiles and build configurations for Arm compatibility
- Create a pull request with the proposed changes using the GitHub MCP Server

## What you will build in this Learning Path

In this Learning Path, you will migrate a real-world legacy application - a matrix multiplication benchmark written with AVX2 intrinsics for x86 - to Arm64 using GitHub Copilot and Docker MCP Toolkit.

The demo repository is available at [github.com/JoeStech/docker-blog-arm-migration](https://github.com/JoeStech/docker-blog-arm-migration).

You will:

- Set up Docker MCP Toolkit with the Arm, GitHub, and Sequential Thinking MCP servers
- Connect VS Code with GitHub Copilot to the MCP Gateway
- Analyze the x86-specific portions of the codebase
- Use AI-assisted MCP workflows to update intrinsics and container configuration
- Review and validate the pull request generated by the AI agent

## What you've accomplished and what's next

You now understand:
- Why Arm migration requires more than rebuilding containers when architecture-specific code is present
- How the Docker MCP Toolkit connects AI assistants to specialized migration tools
- The structured workflow that GitHub Copilot uses to automate migration tasks

Next, you'll install and configure the Docker MCP Toolkit with the three required MCP servers.
