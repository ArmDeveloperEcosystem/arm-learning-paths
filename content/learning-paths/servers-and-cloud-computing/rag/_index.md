title: Deploy a RAG-based Chatbot with llama-cpp-python using KleidiAI on Google Axion processors

minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for software developers, ML engineers, and those looking to deploy production-ready LLM chatbots with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities, knowledge base integration, and performance optimization for Arm Architecture.

learning_objectives:
    - Set up llama-cpp-python optimized for Arm servers.
    - Implement RAG architecture using the Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) vector database.
    - Optimize model performance through 4-bit quantization.
    - Build a web interface for document upload and chat.
    - Monitor and analyze inference performance metrics.

prerequisites:
    - A Google Cloud Axion (or other Arm) compute instance with at least 16 cores, 8GB of RAM, and 32GB disk space.
    - Basic understanding of Python and ML concepts.
    - Familiarity with REST APIs and web services.
    - Basic knowledge of vector databases.
    - Understanding of LLM fundamentals.
