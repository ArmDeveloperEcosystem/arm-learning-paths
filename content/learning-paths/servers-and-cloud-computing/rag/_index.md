title: Deploy a RAG-based Chatbot with llama-cpp-python using KleidiAI on Arm Servers

minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: Enthusiasts, Software developers and ML engineers looking to deploy production-ready LLM chatbots with RAG capabilities, knowledge base integration, and performance optimization for Arm architecture

learning_objectives:
    - Set up llama-cpp-python optimized for Arm servers
    - Implement RAG architecture using FAISS vector database
    - Optimize model performance through 4-bit quantization
    - Build a web interface for document upload and chat
    - Monitor and analyze inference performance metrics

prerequisites:
    - Basic understanding of Python and ML concepts
    - Familiarity with REST APIs and Web Services
    - Basic knowledge of vector databases
    - Understanding of LLM fundamentals
