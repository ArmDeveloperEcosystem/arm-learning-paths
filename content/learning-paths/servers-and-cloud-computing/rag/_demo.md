title: Run a llama.cpp chatbot powered by Arm Kleidi technology
weight: 2

overview: | 
  This Learning Path shows you how to use a c4a-highcpu-72 Google Axion instance powered by an Arm Neoverse CPU to build a simple Token-as-a-Service (TaaS) RAG-enabled server that you can then use to provide a chatbot to serve a small number of concurrent users.

  This architecture is suitable for businesses looking to deploy the latest Generative AI technologies with RAG capabilities using their existing CPU compute capacity and deployment pipelines. 
  
  It enables semantic search over chunked documents using the FAISS vector store. The demo uses the open source llama.cpp framework, which Arm has enhanced with its own Kleidi technologies. Further optimizations are achieved by using the smaller 8 billion parameter Llama 3.1 model, which has been quantized to optimize memory usage. 

  Chat with the Llama-3.1-8B RAG-enabled LLM below to see the performance for yourself, and then follow the Learning Path to build your own Generative AI service on Arm Neoverse.


demo_steps:
  - Type and send a message to the chatbot.
  - Receive the chatbot's reply, including references from RAG data.
  - View performance statistics demonstrating how well Google Axion runs LLMs.

### Specific details to this demo
# ================================================================================
tps_max: 30   # sets stat visuals for tps
tps_ranges:
  - name: Low
    context: Around the average human reading rate of 3-5 words per second.
    color: var(--arm-green)
    min: 0
    max: 5
  - name: High
    context: This is significantly higher than the average human reading rate of 5 words per second, delivering a stable and usable user chatbot experience from the Llama-3.1-8B LLM.
    color: var(--arm-green)
    min: 5
    max: 1000
