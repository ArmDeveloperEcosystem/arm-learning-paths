## Before you begin

Download the [`armswdev/aemfvp-cca-image`](https://hub.docker.com/r/armswdev/aemfvp-cca-image) docker container.

Install [GCC](/install-guides/gcc/) on your machine. Depending on the architecture of your machine, `aarch64` or `x86_64`, you will need to install either the native compiler or the cross-compiler.

## Overview
In the previous section, you were able to boot a guest virtual machine as the Realm. In this section, you will learn how to run an application within that Realm. The application inherits the confidential protection of the guest virtual machine.

A convenient way to run an application inside a Realm, within the context of this example, is to package the application as the "init" process for the guest Linux kernel. 

Linux kernels contain a gzipped cpio format archive. When the kernel boots up, this archive is extracted into the root filesystem. The kernel then checks whether the root filesystem contains a file named "init" and tries to run it. At this point the kernel has booted, and the "init" application executes the system the rest of the way. 

The use of the "init" process to run the application also means that you will not see a shell prompt when you boot the guest virtual machine. The guest kernel will boot, run the application and then exit.

In this section, you will package a simple **hello world** application into the `initramfs` for the guest Linux kernel. 

## Create a simple `initramfs` for the guest Linux kernel

Create a directory in which you will build the simple `initramfs`:

```console
mkdir ~/FM-share
cd ~/FM-share
```
Using a file editor of your choice, create a file named `hello.c` in this directory. Copy the contents below into the file:

```console
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  printf("Hello from the Realm!\n");
  sleep(99);
}
```

Now compile the application as the init executable and package it into the `initramfs`:

```console
aarch64-Linux-gnu-gcc -static hello.c -o init
echo init | cpio -o -H newc | gzip > test.cpio.gz
```
`test.cpio.gz` is the compressed archive you will use as the `initramfs` for the guest Linux kernel.

## Run the application inside the Realm 

Start the docker container with the `FM-share` directory mounted:

```console
docker run -v ~/FM-share:/home/ubuntu/FM-share -it armswdev/aemfvp-cca-image /bin/bash
```
Run the Arm CCA reference stack pre-built binaries on the FVP:

```console
./run-cca-fvp.sh
```
After the host Linux kernel has booted up, you will prompted to log in. Use `root` for both the login and password:

```output

```
With the host Linux kernel running, you can now enable the sharing of files between your host machine and the running simulation. Mount a `9p` drive on the host Linux kernel using `/etc/fstab`:

```console
vi /etc/fstab
```
In the `/etc/fstab` file, add the following line to it:

```console
FM	/mnt		9p	trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L,aname=/mnt	0 	0"
```
Save and close the file. Now run the `mount` command:

```console
mount -a
```
This command mounts the `FM-share` directory in your docker container to the `/mnt` directory of the host Linux kernel running in the FVP. Inspect the contents of `/mnt`:

```console
ls /mnt
```

The output should be:
```output
hello.c  init  test.cpio.gz
```
You can now use `kvmtool` which is a virtualization utility to launch Linux guest images. It supports the creation of Realm guests. Use the `-i` switch to point to the `initramfs` root filesystem you created in the previous step.

```console
lkvm run --realm --irqchip=gicv3-its -p earlycon --network mode=none -c 1 -m 128 -k /realm/Image -i /mnt/test.cpio.gz
```
The Realm guest takes some time to boot up. At the end of the boot, you should see your **hello world** application running in the Realm:

```output
[    9.721618] Freeing unused kernel memory: 9024K
[    9.740198] Run /init as init process
Hello from the Realm!
```
You have successfully run an application inside the Realm!

The Realm will exit after the application runs because it has been packaged as the guest kernel's "init" process.
