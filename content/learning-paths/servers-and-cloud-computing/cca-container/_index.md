who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to learn how to run their applications in a Realm using the Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA).

learning_objectives:
    - Run the Arm reference CCA software stack on an Armv-A AEM Base FVP (Fixed Virtual Platform) with support for RME extensions.
    - Create a virtual machine in a Realm running guest Linux using a pre-built docker container.
    - Run a simple application in a Realm running guest Linux.
    - Obtain a CCA attestation token from the virtual guest in a Realm.

prerequisites:
    - An AArch64 or x86_64 computer running Linux. You can use cloud instances, refer to the list of [Arm cloud service providers](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/).
