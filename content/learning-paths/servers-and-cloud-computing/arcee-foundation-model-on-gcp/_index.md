title: Deploy Arcee AFM-4.5B on Arm-based Google Cloud Axion with Llama.cpp

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for developers and ML engineers who want to deploy Arcee's AFM-4.5B small language model on Google Cloud Axion instances using Llama.cpp.

learning_objectives:
    - Launch an Arm-based Compute Engine instance on Google Cloud Axion
    - Build and install Llama.cpp from source
    - Download and quantize the AFM-4.5B model from Hugging Face
    - Run inference on the quantized model using Llama.cpp
    - Evaluate model quality by measuring perplexity

prerequisites:
    - A [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with permission to launch Axion (`c4a-standard-16` or larger) instances
    - Basic familiarity with Linux and SSH
