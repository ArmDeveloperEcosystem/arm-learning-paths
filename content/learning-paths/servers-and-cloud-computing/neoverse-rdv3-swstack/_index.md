title: Develop and Validate Firmware Pre-Silicon on Arm Neoverse CSS V3

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This advanced topic is for firmware developers, system architects, and silicon validation engineers working on Arm Neoverse CSS platforms who require a pre-silicon workflow for the CSS-V3 reference design using Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs).

learning_objectives:
    - Explain the CSS-V3 architecture and the RD-V3 firmware boot sequence (TF-A, RSE, SCP/MCP/LCP, UEFI/GRUB, Linux)
    - Set up a containerized build environment and sync sources with a pinned manifest using repo
    - Build and boot the RD-V3 firmware stack on FVP and map UART consoles to components
    - Interpret boot logs to verify bring-up and diagnose boot-stage issues
    - Modify platform control firmware (for example, SCP/MCP) and validate changes via pre-silicon simulation
    - Launch a dual-chip RD-V3-R1 simulation and verify AP/MCP coordination
   
prerequisites:
    - Access to an Arm Neoverse-based Linux machine (cloud or local) with at least 80 GB of free storage
    - Familiarity with Linux command-line tools and basic scripting
    - Understanding of firmware boot stages and SoC-level architecture
    - Docker installed, or a GitHub Codespaces-compatible development environment
