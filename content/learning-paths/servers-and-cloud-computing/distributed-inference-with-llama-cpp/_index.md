title: Distributed inference using llama.cpp

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This learning path is for developers with some experience using llama.cpp who want to learn about distributed inference.

learning_objectives: 
    - Set up the main host and worker nodes using llama.cpp
    - Run a large quantized model (e.g., Llama 3.1 405B) on CPUs in a distributed manner on Arm machines

prerequisites:
    - An AWS Graviton4 c8g.16xlarge instance to test Arm performance optimizations, or any [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider or an on-premise Arm server.
    - Familiarity with -> [Deploy a Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot with llama.cpp using KleidiAI on Arm servers](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/llama-cpu)
    - Familiarity with AWS
