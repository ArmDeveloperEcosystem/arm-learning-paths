## Why arm64 in the cloud?
The general architecture of the Internet of Things includes various edge devices, which stream data to the central processing unit, which is deployed to the cloud. 

As an IoT or Arm developer, you are already familiar with app development for your edge devices. Also, you know that arm64-powered devices offer power-efficient computations that enable us to achieve accelerated computing at reduced power consumption. 

Cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure are now adopting this advantage. Specifically, Azure provides arm64-powered virtual machines, which you can use to deploy your apps to utilize arm64 power and reduce the carbon trace.

This tutorial shows how to create the arm64-powered virtual machine in Microsoft Azure and use it for hosting a .NET application. The idea is to show you how to leverage Microsoft Azure, .NET, and aarch64 to build and host a central unit for your IoT solutions.
