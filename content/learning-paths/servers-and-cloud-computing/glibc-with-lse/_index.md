title: Learn about glibc with Large System Extensions (LSE) for performance improvement
description: Optimize glibc performance on Arm servers using LSE atomics, with benchmarking, analysis, and guidance on when LSE improves scalability.

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers interested in learning how to improve the performance of their workloads on Arm servers.

learning_objectives:
- Build and install glibc with LSE on an Arm server
- Benchmark workload performance using glibc with LSE optimizations
- Benchmark MongoDB using glibc with LSE optimizations

prerequisites:
- An Arm based instance from a cloud service provider.
- Review the learning path on [LSE](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/lse/)
