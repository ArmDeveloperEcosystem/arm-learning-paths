## Cobalt 100 Arm-based processor

Azure Cobalt 100 is Microsoft’s first-generation Arm-based processor, designed for cloud-native, scale-out Linux workloads. Based on Arm’s Neoverse-N2 architecture, it is a 64-bit CPU that delivers improved performance and energy efficiency. Running at 3.4 GHz, it provides a dedicated physical core for each vCPU, ensuring consistent and predictable performance. Typical workloads include web and application servers, data analytics, open-source databases, and caching systems.

## Trivy

Trivy is an open-source vulnerability scanner designed to detect security issues in container images, filesystems, and infrastructure configurations. It is widely used in modern DevSecOps workflows to identify known vulnerabilities in operating system packages and application dependencies.

You can use Trivy to perform fast and reliable security scans on container images built for multiple architectures, including Arm64. It helps teams shift security left by detecting vulnerabilities early in the development and CI/CD pipeline.
