title: Deploy Arcee AFM-4.5B on Arm-based AWS Graviton4 with Llama.cpp

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for developers and ML engineers who want to deploy Arcee's AFM-4.5B small language model on AWS Graviton4 instances using Llama.cpp.

learning_objectives:
    - Launch an Arm-based EC2 instance on AWS Graviton4
    - Build and install Llama.cpp from source
    - Download and quantize the AFM-4.5B model from Hugging Face
    - Run inference on the quantized model using Llama.cpp
    - Evaluate model quality by measuring perplexity

prerequisites:
    - An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) with permission to launch Graviton4 (`c8g.4xlarge` or larger) instances
    - Basic familiarity with Linux and SSH
