Benchmarks can run for hours, so its easy to forget about the AWS resources you are using for your *fastpath* lab. 

To avoid unexpected charges, stop the *fastpath* and SUT instances when you are not actively testing.

Terminate instances once you no longer need them -- you may wish to archive the `results/` directory on your fastpath host to save results for later.

Following these practices keeps your *fastpath* lab ready for future experiments without surprise expenses.
