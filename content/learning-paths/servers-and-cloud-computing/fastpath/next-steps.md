You now have a working *fastpath* benchmarking environment consisting of:

- A build host that can compile custom Linux kernels with all *fastpath* dependencies.
- A reusable *fastpath* host which can generate and orchestrate benchmark plans, as well as analyze results.
- An SUT that can run the benchmark plan.


Continue exploring by revisiting the source documentation:

- [*fastpath* documentation](https://fastpath.docs.arm.com/en/latest/index.html) for advanced deployment models, additional benchmarks, and troubleshooting tips.
- [Kernel Install Guide](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/kernel-build/) for deeper dives into kernel customization, *fastpath* tagging, and artifact management.
- [Tuxmake documentation](https://docs.tuxmake.org) to learn how to tailor build matrices, cross-compilation targets, and caching strategies that complement the *fastpath* workflow.

Extend this learning path by experimenting with new kernel patches, expanding the benchmark suite, or automating the instance lifecycle with Terraform.
