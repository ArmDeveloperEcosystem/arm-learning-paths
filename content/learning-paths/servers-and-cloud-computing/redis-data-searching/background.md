## Explore Google Axion C4A Arm instances

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Google's custom Axion CPU, based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. These virtual machines deliver strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## Explore Redis

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store developed under the [Redis project](https://redis.io/). It is used as a database, cache, and message broker, supporting a variety of data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets.

Redis is designed for high performance, low latency, and high throughput, making it ideal for real-time applications. It supports persistence, replication, Lua scripting, transactions, and high availability through Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

Redis is widely adopted for caching, session management, real-time analytics, pub/sub messaging, and leaderboards in gaming and web applications. It integrates seamlessly with programming languages like Python, Java, Go, and Node.js.
