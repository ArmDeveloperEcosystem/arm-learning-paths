## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## Redis

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open-source, **in-memory data structure store** developed under the [Redis project](https://redis.io/). It is used as a **database**, **cache**, and **message broker**, supporting a variety of data structures such as **strings**, **hashes**, **lists**, **sets**, and **sorted sets**.

Redis is designed for **high performance**, **low latency**, and **high throughput**, making it ideal for real-time applications. It supports **persistence**, **replication**, **Lua scripting**, **transactions**, and **high availability** through Redis Sentinel and **automatic partitioning** with Redis Cluster.

Redis is widely adopted for **caching**, **session management**, **real-time analytics**, **pub/sub messaging**, and **leaderboards** in gaming and web applications. It integrates seamlessly with programming languages like **Python**, **Java**, **Go**, and **Node.js**.
