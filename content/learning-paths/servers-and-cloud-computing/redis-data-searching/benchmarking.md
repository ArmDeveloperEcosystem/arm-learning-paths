## Redis Benchmarking by redis-benchmark
The `redis-benchmark` tool is an official performance testing utility for Redis. It helps measure to throughput (requests per second) and latency (response delay) across different workloads.

### Prerequisites
Ensure Redis server is running and accessible:

```console
redis-server &
redis-cli ping
```
### Benchmark SET (Write Performance)
The `SET` benchmark helps validate Redis’s ability to handle high insertion rates efficiently on Arm-based servers.

The following command benchmarks data insertion performance:

```console
redis-benchmark -t set -n 100000 -c 50
```
**Explanation:**

- `-t set`: Runs the benchmark only for **SET** operations.  
- `-n 100000`: Performs **100,000 total requests**.  
- `-c 50`: Simulates **50 concurrent clients**.

You should see an output similar to:

```output
====== SET ======
  100000 requests completed in 0.67 seconds
  50 parallel clients
  3 bytes payload
  keep alive: 1
  host configuration "save": 3600 1 300 100 60 10000
  host configuration "appendonly": no
  multi-thread: no

Latency by percentile distribution:

99.975% <= 0.903 milliseconds (cumulative count 99975)
99.983% <= 1.007 milliseconds (cumulative count 99983)
100.000% <= 1.103 milliseconds (cumulative count 100000)

```

### Benchmark GET (Read/Search Performance)
Now test data retrieval performance separately.

```console
redis-benchmark -t get -n 100000 -c 50
```
**Explanation:**

- `-t get`: Runs the benchmark only for **GET** operations.  
- `-n 100000`: Executes **100,000 total requests**.  
- `-c 50`: Simulates **50 concurrent clients** performing reads.

You should see an output similar to:

```output
====== GET ======
  100000 requests completed in 0.67 seconds
  50 parallel clients
  3 bytes payload
  keep alive: 1
  host configuration "save": 3600 1 300 100 60 10000

### Benchmark Metrics Explanation

- **Throughput:** Number of operations (requests) Redis can process per second.
- **Latency:** Latency reflects the time it takes for Redis to complete a single request, measured in milliseconds (ms).  
- **avg:** Average time taken to process a request across the entire test.
- **min:** Fastest observed response time (best case).
- **p50:** Median latency — 50% of requests completed faster than this value.
- **p95:** 95th percentile — 95% of requests completed faster than this value.
- **p99:** 99th percentile — shows near worst-case latency, key for reliability analysis.
- **max:** Slowest observed response time (worst case).
