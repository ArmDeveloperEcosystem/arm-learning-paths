title: Deploy Redis for data searching on Google Cloud C4A (Arm-based Axion VMs)

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This learning path is intended for software developers deploying and optimizing Redis-based data searching workloads on Linux/Arm64 environments, specifically using Google Cloud C4A virtual machines powered by Axion processors.

learning_objectives:
  - Provision an Arm-based SUSE SLES virtual machine on Google Cloud (C4A with Axion processors)
  - Install Redis on a SUSE Arm64 (C4A) instance
  - Verify Redis functionality by running the server and performing baseline data insertion and retrieval tests on the Arm64 VM  
  - Measure Redis SET (write) and GET (read) performance using the official redis-benchmark tool to evaluate throughput and latency on Arm64 (Aarch64)

prerequisites:
  - A [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/free) account with billing enabled
  - Basic familiarity with [Redis](https://redis.io/)
