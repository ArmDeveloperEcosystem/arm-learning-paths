who_is_this_for: This learning path is designed for data engineers, platform engineers, and developers who aim to build high-performance analytics pipelines on Arm64-based Google Cloud C4A Axion processors using Apache Arrow and Arrow Flight.

learning_objectives:
 - Deploy Apache Arrow–based data processing workloads on Google Cloud C4A Axion processors
 - Set up and run an Arrow Flight server for high-throughput, low-latency data transport
 - Read and write columnar data formats such as Parquet and ORC using Apache Arrow
 - Integrate Arrow with object storage (MinIO) for cloud-native analytics workflows
 - Validate performance benefits of Arrow and Arrow Flight on Arm-based infrastructure

prerequisites:
  - A [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/free) account with billing enabled
  - Basic familiarity with Python
  - Basic understanding of data formats such as Parquet or ORC
  - Familiarity with Linux command-line operations
