If you are new to cloud computing, please refer to [Getting started with Servers and Cloud Computing](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/intro/). It provides an introduction to the Arm servers available from various cloud service providers. 

## Connect to an AWS Arm-based instance

In this example you will build and run a C++ application on an AWS Graviton 4 (`r8g.xlarge`) instance running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. 

Create the AWS instance using your AWS account. Connect to the instance using SSH or AWS Session Manager so you can enter shell commands. 

Once connected, run the following commands to confirm the operating system and architecture.

```bash
cat /etc/*lsb*
```

You see output similar to:

```output
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=24.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=noble
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS"
```

Next, confirm we are using a 64-bit Arm-based system using the following command

```bash
uname -m
```

You see the following output:

```output
aarch64
```

## Install Different Versions of the GNU Compiler Collection

An effective way to improve performance on arm may not only come from optimal flag use, but from using a recent compiler version. 
Older compilers might not fully leverage the latest hardware features, particularly when targeting cutting-edge Arm processors, resulting in less optimized code. 

In your terminal and run the following command to install an older version of the GNU compiler collective, version 9:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-9 g++-9 -y
```

Directly run the `g++-9 --version` command to confirm you have the same output as below.

```output
g++-9 (Ubuntu 9.5.0-6ubuntu2) 9.5.0
