title: Deploy Apache Flink on Google Cloud C4A (Arm-based Axion VMs)

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This learning path is intended for software developers deploying and optimizing Apache Flink workloads on Linux/Arm64 environments, specifically using Google Cloud C4A virtual machines powered by Axion processors.

learning_objectives:
  - Provision an Arm-based SUSE SLES virtual machine on Google Cloud (C4A with Axion processors)
  - Install Apache Flink on a SUSE Arm64 (C4A) instance
  - Validate Flink functionality by starting the Flink cluster and running a simple baseline job (e.g., WordCount) on the Arm64 VM
  - Benchmark Flink performance using internal JMH-based micro-benchmarks on Arm64 (Aarch64) architecture

prerequisites:
  - A [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/free) account with billing enabled
  - Basic familiarity with [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) and its runtime environment
