## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## Apache Flink

[Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) is an open-source, distributed **stream and batch data processing framework** developed under the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/).

Flink is designed for **high-performance, low-latency, and stateful computations** on both unbounded (streaming) and bounded (batch) data. It provides a robust runtime and APIs in **Java**, **Scala**, and **Python** for building scalable, fault-tolerant data processing pipelines.

Flink is widely used for **real-time analytics**, **event-driven applications**, **data pipelines**, and **machine learning workloads**. It integrates seamlessly with popular systems such as **Apache Kafka**, **Hadoop**, and various **cloud storage services**.

To learn more, visit the [Apache Flink official website](https://flink.apache.org/) and explore the [documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.1/).
