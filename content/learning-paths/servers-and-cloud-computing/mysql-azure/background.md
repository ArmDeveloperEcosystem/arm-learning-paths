## MySQL

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for storing, organizing, and managing structured data. It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing databases, making it one of the most popular choices for web applications, enterprise solutions, and cloud deployments.

You can use MySQL for reliable, high-performance data management. Take advantage of features such as transactions, replication, partitioning, and robust security to support both small applications and large-scale production systems.
