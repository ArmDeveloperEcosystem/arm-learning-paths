## MySQL

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for storing, organizing, and managing structured data. It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing databases, making it one of the most popular choices for web applications, enterprise solutions, and cloud deployments.

It is known for its reliability, high performance, and ease of use. MySQL supports features like transactions, replication, partitioning, and robust security, making it suitable for both small applications and large-scale production systems.
