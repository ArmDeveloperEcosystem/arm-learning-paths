title: Run the vvenc H.266 encoder on Arm servers

author: Willen Yang

minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to build and run the VVenC® (Fraunhofer Versatile Video Encoder) H.266 project on Arm servers and measure the performance.

learning_objectives:
- Build the VVenC® H.266 encoder project on an Arm-based server.
- Run vvenc on an Arm-based server to encode a real 1080p video file and measure the performance.

armips:
- Neoverse

prerequisites:
- An Arm Linux system or an [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider. This Learning Path has been tested on an Arm Neoverse N2-based Alibaba cloud ECS instance(g8y), running Ubuntu 22.04.

operatingsystems:
    - Linux

skilllevels: Introductory
subjects: Libraries

tools_software_languages:
