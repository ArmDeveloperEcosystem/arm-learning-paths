## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Google’s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## TensorFlow 

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an **open-source machine learning and deep learning framework** developed by **Google**.  It helps developers and researchers **build, train, and deploy AI models** efficiently across **CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs**.

With support for **neural networks**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **computer vision**, TensorFlow is widely used for **AI research and production**.  
Its **flexibility** and **scalability** make it ideal for both **cloud** and **edge environments**.
