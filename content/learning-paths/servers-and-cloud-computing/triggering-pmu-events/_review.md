        question: >
            Some PMU events will not occur on the Neoverse CPUs if they are not provided by a system component.
        answers:
            - True
            - False
        correct_answer: 1                    
        explanation: >
            Events like LL_CACHE_RD count transactions returned from outside of the Neoverse N2 CPU.

        question: >
            Which of the following events always occurs during an L2 D-cache access from a load instruction?
        answers:
            - L2D_CACHE_REFILL
            - L2D_CACHE_RD
            - BUS_ACCESS
            - L2D_CACHE_WR
        correct_answer: 2          
        explanation: >
            L2D_CACHE_RD counts an L2 D-cache access caused by a load or read. A refill and bus access only occurs when there is a miss. L2D_CACHE_WR is only counted when an L2 D-cache access is caused by a store or write.

        question: >
            What scenario will not trigger L1D_CACHE_WB in a Neoverse N2 core?
        answers:
            - A writeback from the L1-D cache as a result of a Cache Maintenance Operation
            - A full line write to the L2, without writing to the L1 D-cache 
            - A cache line writeback to the L2 cache as a result of a snoop 
            - A victim cache line eviction from the L1 D-cache
        correct_answer: 2
        explanation: >
            L1D_CACHE_WB counts any writeback of dirty data from the L1 D-cache to the L2 cache, including writebacks from snoops, CMOs or evictions. Writing directly to the L2 cache, such as in write-streaming mode, will not result in a writeback from the L1 D-cache to the L2. L1D_CACHE_WB is Implementation Defined whether the event counts for

        question: >
            Why do I-side cache refills typically count less than D-side cache refills?
        answers:
            - There will always be fewer instructions
            - I-side cache accesses can result in a snoop to the D-side cache
            - Instructions use up less memory than data
        correct_answer: 2
        explanation: >
            In the Neoverse N2, instruction fetches that miss in the I-cache will look in the D-cache and the L2 cache.
