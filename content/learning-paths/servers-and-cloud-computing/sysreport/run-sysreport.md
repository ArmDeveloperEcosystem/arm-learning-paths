## About Sysreport

Sysreport is a system capability reporting tool that gives application developers a quick summary of the performance features available on a Linux system. It reports the system configuration in a way that is focused on performance analysis.

The tool is aimed at anyone trying to profile performance on Arm Linux systems; this includes cloud instances, bare metal servers, small developer boards, and Raspberry Pi devices.

After running Sysreport, a summary is generated and displayed on screen. Information reported includes hardware configuration, operating system configuration (build time), and other configuration settings that can be changed. By default, the tool displays advice about possible configuration changes you can make in order to improve the ability to collect performance information. You can disable the advice using the `--no-advice` option.

Example use cases for Sysreport include:

* As a developer, you want to know if a cloud instance supports a particular performance feature so that you can debug a performance problem
* As a developer, you want a quick, single-page summary of a system's performance configuration so that you don't need to run multiple commands manually to gather what you need
* As a developer, you would like to know suggested configuration changes you can make to a system so that you can improve your ability to collect performance information

## Run Sysreport

Run Sysreport with the following command:

```console
python sysreport.py
```
