## Google Axion C4A series

The Google Axion C4A series is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machine offer strong performance ideal for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machine while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## MongoDB
MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility.

It stores data in JSON-like BSON documents, making it ideal for modern applications that require dynamic, schema-less data structures.

MongoDB is widely used for web, mobile, IoT, and real-time analytics workloads. Learn more from the [MongoDB official website](https://www.mongodb.com/) and its [official documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).
