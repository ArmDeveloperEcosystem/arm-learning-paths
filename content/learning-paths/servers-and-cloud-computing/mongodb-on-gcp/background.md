## Google Axion C4A series

The C4A series is a family of Arm-based instance types for Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machine offer strong performance suitable for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective virtual machine while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database designed for performance, scalability, and flexibility. It stores data in JSON-like BSON documents, making it well suited to applications that require dynamic, schema-less data models.

MongoDB is widely used for web, mobile, IoT, and real-time analytics workloads. Learn more on the [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/) and in the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).
