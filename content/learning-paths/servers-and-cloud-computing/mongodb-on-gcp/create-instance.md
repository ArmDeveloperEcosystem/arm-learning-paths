## Overview

This section walks you through creating a Google Axion C4A Arm virtual machine on GCP with the `c4a-standard-4` (4 vCPUs, 16 GB Memory) machine type, using the **Google Cloud Console**.

If you haven't set up a Google Cloud account, see the Learning Path [Getting started with Google Cloud Platform](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/google/).

## Create an Arm-based virtual machine (C4A)

To create a VM based on the C4A Arm architecture:

1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Go to **Compute Engine** and select **Create instance**.
3. In **Machine configuration**:
   - Enter the **Instance name**, **Region**, and **Zone**.
   - Set **Series** to `C4A`.
   - Choose a machine type such as `c4a-standard-4`.  
     ![Screenshot of GCP Create instance page showing C4A series and c4a-standard-4 selected alt-text#center](./select-instance.png "Selecting the C4A series and c4a-standard-4 machine type")
4. In **OS and storage**, select **Change**, choose **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** as the operating system, and **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9** as the version. Make sure you select the **Arm** image.
5. In **Networking**, enable **Allow HTTP traffic** so you can test services later in this Learning Path.
6. Select **Create** to launch the instance.

Do not leave **Allow HTTP traffic** enabled permanently. For long-term use, restrict access to only the IP addresses you need.

To open a shell on the VM, select **SSH** in the instance details page. Use this terminal for the commands in the next sections, where you will install and configure MongoDB on your Axion C4A instance.
