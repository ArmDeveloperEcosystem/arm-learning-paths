## Introduction

This guide walks you through provisioning **Google Axion C4A Arm virtual machine** on GCP with the **c4a-standard-4 (4 vCPUs, 16 GB Memory)** machine type, using the **Google Cloud Console**. 

If you are new to Google Cloud, it is recommended to follow the [GCP Quickstart Guide to Create a virtual machine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance).

For more details, kindly follow the Learning Path on [Getting Started with Google Cloud Platform](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/google/).
