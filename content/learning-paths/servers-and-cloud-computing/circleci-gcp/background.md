## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Googleâ€™s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## CircleCI

CircleCI is a cloud-based **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)** platform that automates the process of **building, testing, and deploying software**.

It integrates with popular version control systems like **GitHub**, **Bitbucket**, and **GitLab**, and allows developers to define custom workflows in a `.circleci/config.yml` file using **YAML syntax**.

CircleCI supports multiple environments, including **Docker**, **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**, and offers advanced features like **parallelism**, **caching**, and **matrix builds** to speed up pipelines and improve efficiency.

It is widely used for **automating tests, running builds, deploying applications, and ensuring code quality** in modern development workflows. Learn more from the [CircleCI official website](https://circleci.com/) and its [documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/).
