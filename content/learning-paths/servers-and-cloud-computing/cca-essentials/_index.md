title: Run an end-to-end Attestation Flow with Arm CCA

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers who want to learn how to run an end-to-end attestation flow with Arm's Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA).  

learning_objectives:
     - Describe how you can use attestation with Arm's Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA).
     - Deploy a simple workload in a CCA realm on an Armv9-A AEM Base Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) that has support for RME extensions. 
     - Connect the workload with additional software services to create an end-to-end example that uses attestation to unlock the confidential processing of data.

prerequisites:
    - An AArch64 or x86_64 computer running Linux. You can use cloud instances, see this list of [Arm cloud service providers](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/).
    - Completion of [Get Started with CCA Attestation and Veraison](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/cca-veraison) Learning Path.
    - Completion of the [Run an application in a Realm using the Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA)](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/cca-container/) Learning Path.
