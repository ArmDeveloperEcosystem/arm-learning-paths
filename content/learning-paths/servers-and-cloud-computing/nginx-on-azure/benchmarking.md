## NGINX Benchmarking by ApacheBench

To understand how your NGINX deployment performs under load, you can benchmark it using ApacheBench (ab). ApacheBench is a lightweight command-line tool for benchmarking HTTP servers. It measures performance metrics like requests per second, response time, and throughput under concurrent load.


1. Install ApacheBench

On **Ubuntu Pro 24.04 LTS**, ApacheBench is available as part of the `apache2-utils` package:
```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2-utils -y
```

2. Verify Installation

```console
ab -V
```
You should see output similar to:

```output
This is ApacheBench, Version 2.3 <$Revision: 1923142 $>
Copyright 1996 Adam Twiss, Zeus Technology Ltd, http://www.zeustech.net/
Licensed to The Apache Software Foundation, http://www.apache.org/
```

3. Basic Benchmark Syntax

The general syntax for running an ApacheBench test is:

```console
ab -n <total_requests> -c <concurrent_clients> <http://host:port/path>
```

Now run an example:

```console
ab -n 1000 -c 50 http://localhost/
```
This sends **1000 total requests** with **50 concurrent connections** to `http://localhost/`.

You should see a output similar to:
```output
This is ApacheBench, Version 2.3 <$Revision: 1903618 $>

### Interpret Benchmark Results:

ApacheBench outputs several metrics. Key ones to focus on include:

  - Requests per second: Average throughput.
  - Time per request: Latency per request.
  - Failed request: Should ideally be zero.
  - Transfer rate: Bandwidth used by the responses.

### Analysis of results from NGINX benchmarking on Arm-based Azure Cobalt-100  

These benchmark results highlight the strong performance characteristics of NGINX running on Arm64-based Azure VMs (such as the D4ps_v6 instance type):

- High Requests Per second(31,523.86 requests/sec), demonstrating high throughput under concurrent load.
- Response time per request averaged **1.586 ms**, indicating efficient handling of requests with minimal delay.
- **Zero failed requests**, confirming stability and reliability during testing.
- Consistently low **connection and processing times** (mean â‰ˆ 1 ms), ensuring smooth performance.

Overall, these results illustrate that NGINX on Arm64 machines provides a highly performant solution for web workloads on Azure. You can also use the same benchmarking framework to compare results on equivalent x86-based Azure instances, which provides useful insight into relative performance and cost efficiency across architectures.
