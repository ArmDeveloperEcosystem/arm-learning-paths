## Cobalt 100 Arm-based processor

Azure’s Cobalt 100 is built on Microsoft's first-generation, in-house Arm-based processor: the Cobalt 100. Designed entirely by Microsoft and based on Arm’s Neoverse N2 architecture, this 64-bit CPU delivers improved performance and energy efficiency across a broad spectrum of cloud-native, scale-out Linux workloads. These include web and application servers, data analytics, open-source databases, caching systems, and more. Running at 3.4 GHz, the Cobalt 100 processor allocates a dedicated physical core for each vCPU, ensuring consistent and predictable performance. 

To learn more about Cobalt 100, refer to the blog [Announcing the preview of new Azure virtual machine based on the Azure Cobalt 100 processor](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurecompute/announcing-the-preview-of-new-azure-vms-based-on-the-azure-cobalt-100-processor/4146353).

## NGINX

NGINX is a high-performance, open-source web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. Originally developed by Igor Sysoev, NGINX is known for its event-driven, asynchronous architecture, which enables it to handle high concurrency with low resource usage.

There are three main variants of NGINX:
- **NGINX Open Source**– Free and [open-source version available at nginx.org](https://nginx.org)
- **NGINX Plus**- [Commercial edition of NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/) with features like dynamic reconfig, active health checks, and monitoring.
- **NGINX Unit**-  A lightweight, dynamic application server that complements NGINX. [Learn more at unit.nginx.org](https://unit.nginx.org/).
