# Azure Cobalt 100 and NGINX overview

This section introduces Azure’s Cobalt 100 Arm-based processor and the NGINX options you can use in this Learning Path.

## Azure Cobalt 100 Arm-based processor

Azure’s Cobalt 100 is Microsoft’s first-generation, in-house Arm-based processor. Built on Arm Neoverse N2, this 64-bit CPU delivers strong performance and energy efficiency for cloud-native, scale-out Linux workloads such as web and application servers, data analytics, open-source databases, and caching systems. Running at 3.4 GHz, Cobalt 100 allocates a dedicated physical core for each vCPU, which helps ensure consistent and predictable performance.

## NGINX

NGINX is a high-performance, open-source web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. Known for its event-driven, asynchronous architecture, NGINX handles high concurrency with low resource usage.

There are three main variants of NGINX:
- NGINX Open Source: free and [open-source version available at nginx.org](https://nginx.org)
- NGINX Plus: [Commercial edition of NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/) with features like dynamic reconfig, active health checks, and monitoring
- NGINX Unit: a lightweight, dynamic application server that complements NGINX ([learn more at unit.nginx.org](https://unit.nginx.org/))
