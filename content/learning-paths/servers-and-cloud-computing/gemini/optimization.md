## Overview

In this section, you explore how Gemini CLI can assist with Arm optimization discussions and decision-making.

Gemini CLI complements traditional tools such as profilers and benchmarks.

## Ask optimization-focused questions

Examples include:

```text
What performance considerations are important on Arm?
```

```text
Where should I start when optimizing this workload for Arm?
```

Gemini can suggest:
- Areas to investigate
- Relevant Arm architecture concepts
- Appropriate tooling

## Set expectations

Gemini CLI does not replace:
- Performance profilers
- Benchmarks
- Hardware-specific tuning

Instead, it helps you ask better questions and focus your optimization efforts.

You have now completed the Gemini CLI Learning Path.
