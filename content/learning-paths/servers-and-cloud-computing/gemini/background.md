## The benefits of Arm-based development environments

Arm-based systems are widely used across cloud, edge, and embedded environments due to their performance, efficiency, and scalability. Developers targeting Arm platforms often work across a mix of Linux and macOS systems and need tooling that understands Arm architecture constraints and best practices.

Gemini CLI is designed to run consistently across operating systems, including Arm Linux distributions and macOS on Arm. This makes it a practical command-line assistant for developers building, migrating, or optimizing software for Arm-based environments.

## Discover Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI is Google’s command-line interface for interacting with the Gemini AI assistant. It allows developers to ask questions, explore design options, and reason about code and systems directly from the terminal.

Gemini CLI supports tasks such as:
- Understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Reasoning about architecture and design decisions
- Exploring portability and migration considerations
- Assisting with development and troubleshooting workflows

Because Gemini CLI is architecture-agnostic and runs on Arm-based systems, it can be used as part of an Arm-native development workflow without relying on x86-only tools.

In this Learning Path, you configure Gemini CLI with Arm-specific context and integrate additional tooling so that Gemini can provide more relevant guidance for Arm development tasks.

For more information, see the [Gemini CLI documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/cli).
