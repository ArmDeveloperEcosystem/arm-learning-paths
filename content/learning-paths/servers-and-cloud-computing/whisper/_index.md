title: Accelerate Whisper on Arm with Hugging Face Transformers

minutes_to_complete: 15

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for software developers familiar with basic machine learning concepts and looking to run the OpenAI Whisper Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model efficiently, using an Arm-based cloud instance.

learning_objectives:
    - Install the dependencies for the Whisper ASR Model.
    - Run the Whisper model using Hugging Face Transformers.
    - Enable performance-enhancing features for running the model on Arm CPUs.
    - Evaluate transcript generation times using Whisper.


prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based compute instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/intro/) running Ubuntu with 32 cores, 8GB of RAM, and 32GB of disk space.
    - Basic knowledge of Python.
    - Familiarity with machine learning concepts.
    - Familiarity with the fundamentals of the Whisper ASR Model.
