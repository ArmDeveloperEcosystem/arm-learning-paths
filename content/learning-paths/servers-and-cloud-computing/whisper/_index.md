draft: true
cascade:
    draft: true

minutes_to_complete: 15

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for software developers looking to run the Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) model efficiently. You will use an Arm-based cloud instance to run and build speech transcription based applications.

learning_objectives:
    - Install the dependencies to run the Whisper Model
    - Run the OpenAI Whisper model using Hugging Face Transformers.
    - Enable performance-enhancing features for running the model on Arm CPUs.
    - Compare the total time taken to generate transcript with Whisper.


prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based compute instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/intro/) with 32 cores, 8GB of RAM, and 32GB disk space running Ubuntu.
    - Basic understanding of Python and ML concepts.
    - Understanding of Whisper ASR Model fundamentals.
