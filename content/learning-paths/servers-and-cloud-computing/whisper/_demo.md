title: Demo - Whisper Voice Audio transcription on Arm
overview: | 
  This Learning Path shows you how to use a c8g.8xlarge AWS Graviton4 instance, powered by an Arm Neoverse CPU, to build a simple Transcription-as-a-Service server.

  This architecture is suitable for businesses looking to deploy the latest Generative AI technologies with audio transcription capabilities using their existing CPU compute capacity and deployment pipelines. This demo provides speech recognition using the `whisper-large-v3-turbo model`, deployed using the Hugging Face Transformers framework.

  Record audio from your browser to interact with the Whisper model and send it to be transcribed, so you csn see the performance for yourself. Note that no recorded audio is ever saved on our servers. 
  
  After running the demo, you can follow the Learning Path to build your own Generative AI service on Arm Neoverse.


demo_steps:
  - Record your voice (grant microphone permissions to your browser).
  - Review and send the audio file to the sever for transcription.
  - Receive the transcribed output and view stats.

### Specific details to this demo
# ================================================================================
stats_description: |
  The 'total time' for a whisper voice-to-text process refers to the complete duration taken from the moment the audio input is received until the final text output is generated. This includes several related times such as the 'pre-processing time', which is the time taken to prepare the audio data for transcription, the 'transcription time', which is the actual time spent converting the audio to text, and the 'post-processing time', which involves refining and formatting the transcribed text. Each of these stages contributes to the overall 'total time' and can vary depending on factors such as audio quality, length of the audio, and the efficiency of the transcription algorithm.
