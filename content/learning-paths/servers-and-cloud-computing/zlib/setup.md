## Detailed Steps

Most Linux distributions use `zlib` without any optimizations. For the Arm architecture this means that CRC (cyclic redundancy check) instructions are not utilized for best performance. Installing and using a `zlib` which has been optimized may provide performance improvement for applications doing data compression. 

Cloudflare `zlib` is one version which has optimizations included. There are other `zlib` versions which have been optimized. The process to use them should be similar.

## Confirm crc32 is included in the processor flags

All recent Arm servers and most Armv8.0-A and above processors have support for CRC instructions. 

To check if a Linux system has support use the `lscpu` command and look for `crc32` in the listed flags.
```bash { ret_code="0" }
lscpu | grep crc32
```

If the machine is confirmed to include `crc32` it may benefit from `zlib-cloudflare`. 

## Check if the default zlib includes crc32 instructions

{{% notice Note %}}
Some Linux system may already make use of `crc32` with the default library. If the default `zlib` is already optimized, then using `zlib-cloudflare` may not have any impact on performance. 
{{% /notice %}}

If `zlib` is not installed, you can install it with the following command on Ubuntu, as well as additional packages for this Learning Path. 

```bash
sudo apt install -y libzstd1 build-essential git
```

Ubuntu and Debian Linux distributions put `zlib` in `/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu`

To check if there are any CRC instructions in a library use `objdump` to disassemble and look for `crc32` instructions. 

```bash
objdump -d /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 | awk -F" " '{print $3}' | grep crc32 | wc -l
```

If the result is 0 then there are no `crc32` instructions used in the library. 

## Install Cloudflare zlib

If there are no `crc32` instructions in `zlib` then `zlib-cloudflare` may increase application performance. 

To build and install `zlib-cloudflare` navigate to an empty directory and use these commands.

```bash
mkdir tmp ; pushd tmp
git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/zlib.git
cd zlib && ./configure 
make && sudo make install
popd
rm -rf tmp
```

If successful, `zlib-cloudflare` is installed in `/usr/local/lib`

To install `zlib` somewhere else which does not require `sudo` to install it, use the prefix argument to configure to select another location such as 
```console
./configure --prefix=$HOME/zlib
```
This results in `zlib` being installed in `$HOME/zlib` instead and the `sudo` is not needed for the `make install`.

## Configuring zlib

Since `zlib` is a shared library there are different ways to configure its usage. 

Below is a simple C program to demonstrate `zlib` configuration.

Use a text editor to save the code below in a file named `test.c`

```C { file_name="test.c" }
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "zlib.h"

int main()
{

    gzFile myfile;

    printf("%s\n", zlibVersion());

    myfile = gzopen("testfile.gz", "wb");

    gzprintf(myfile,"Hello gzipped file!\n");

    gzclose(myfile);

    exit(0);
}
```

Compile the example program:

```bash
gcc test.c -o test -lz
```

Run the program and see the version.

```bash
./test
```

The printed version will be something like:
```output
1.2.11
```

Use `ldd` to see the location of the shared library.
```bash
ldd ./test
```

The output will show the shared libraries used by test.
```output
linux-vdso.so.1 (0x0000ffffababe000)
libz.so.1 => /lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0x0000ffffaba52000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x0000ffffab8df000)
/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1 (0x0000ffffaba8e000)
```

## Use zlib-cloudflare

To run `test` with `zlib-cloudflare` instead of the default.

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libz.so ./test
```

The `LD_PRELOAD` variable informs the linker to use these libraries before the default libraries. 

The version of `zlib-cloudflare` will print. It may be older than the default, but you are interested in `crc32` not using the latest.

In the next section you will explore how to use `zlib-cloudflare` in an application doing data compression.
