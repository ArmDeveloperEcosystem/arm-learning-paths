## Introduction

Large System Extensions (LSE) improve the performance of atomic operations in systems with many processors. Understanding LSE helps developers port software applications to Arm servers running Neoverse processors.

In programming, when multiple processors or threads access shared data, and at least one is writing, the operations must be atomic. This means the data accesses must be treated as a single operation relative to the other processors to avoid data race conditions. Microprocessors are designed to treat sequences such as read-modify-write and memory-register exchange as single operations, even when they create multiple accesses to memory. This hardware makes programming easier. 

The Armv8.1-A architecture introduced new atomic instructions. Atomics are alternatives to the load, store exclusive sequences used in previous architecture versions.

The [Arm Architecture Reference Manual](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/latest) refers to the atomic instructions as Large System Extensions (LSE). You may see them referred to as FEAT_LSE in documentation or in compiler information indicating support for the atomic instructions. 

From the Architecture Reference Manual, FEAT_LSE introduces a set of atomic instructions:

- Compare and Swap instructions, CAS and CASP
- Atomic memory operation instructions, LD\<op\> and ST\<op\>, where \<op\> is one of ADD, CLR, EOR, SET, SMAX, SMIN, UMAX, and UMIN
- Swap instruction, SWP

Additional architecture improvements were made in Armv8.4-A and made optional in Armv8.2-A, but the low-level hardware details are not covered here. This additional feature is referred to as FEAT_LSE2 in the Architecture Reference Manual.

In architecture versions prior to LSE, read-modify-write sequences use load exclusive and store exclusive instructions. Incrementing a shared variable uses a sequence such as:

**LDXR** to read current count (load exclusive)   
**ADD** to add one to the shared variable    
**STXR** to attempt to store to memory (store exclusive)     
**CMP** to check if the operation succeeded

Because atomic accesses use multiple instructions each processor is required to implement an exclusive monitor. The exclusive monitor is a hardware state machine to track the read-modify-write sequences and match up the loads and stores. You can read about the exclusive monitor in the technical reference manual of a processor such as the [Cortex-A53](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0500/j/Level-1-Memory-System/L1-Data-memory-system/Internal-exclusive-monitor?lang=en).

If the number of processors is small, this works fine. Increasing the number of processor combined with increased caching, make it hard to maintain fairness as processors closer to each other have a better chance of completing atomic sequences.

With LSE, atomic instructions provide a non-interruptible read-modify-write sequence in a single instruction. The atomic instructions can perform simple arithmetic or logical operations on the specified memory location, and return the updated value to the processor. Programmers benefit from the atomic instructions because it’s easier to specify a single instruction compared to a sequence of instructions with a loop around them if the sequence fails. 

Atomic instructions work better in situations such as networking software where many counters are atomically updated from many processors. The atomic instructions result in faster performance and less variability. 

With this introduction, let’s see how this applies to Arm Neoverse processors. 

## LSE in Neoverse Processors

AWS currently offers three generations of Graviton processors. The first instance type is A1, and was announced in 2018. Announced in 2019, Graviton2 processors provide a significant performance uplift from A1. The Graviton2 instance types are M6g, T4g, C6g, and R6g. C7g instances, powered by the AWS Graviton3 processors, were announced in 2021.

AWS A1 instances are based on the Cortex-A72 processor. The Cortex-A72 implements the Armv8.0-A architecture and does not include the atomic instructions. All of the AWS EC2 instances based on the Neoverse-N1 and Neoverse-V1 processors include the atomic instructions. 

Other cloud service providers such as Oracle Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud offer instances based on the Neoverse-N1 processor, and support the atomic instructions.

One of the common performance issues when migrating to Neoverse is running software that does not utilize LSE. Software built with load exclusives and store exclusives usually runs slower on Neoverse instances. 

Let’s look at how to make sure you get the best performance on Neoverse.

**How do I know if my Linux kernel supports atomics?**

There are a couple of ways to check. First, look in the kernel ring buffer messages to see if LSE is present:

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep LSE
```
If LSE is present, the output from the command will look like:

```output
[    0.001296] CPU features: detected: LSE atomic instructions
```

Another way is to use the lscpu command to print the processor information:

```bash
lscpu
```
Here is the output from running `lscpu` an AWS A1 instance:

```output

For Neoverse-N1 the “atomics” flag is listed indicating LSE support.

**Which versions of the GCC compiler support LSE?**

LSE support started in GCC 6, but currently GCC 10 and GCC 11 are good to use.

**What are out-of-line atomics?**

When an atomic operation is encountered by the compiler, calls to helper functions that provide the best implementation for the processor are inserted instead of directly generating in-line instructions.

The gcc command line options -moutline-atomics and -mno-outline-atomics enable or disable calls to the out-of-line helpers. 

With GCC 9.3.1 and later, you can use the above options to enable/disable out-of-line atomics.

With GCC 10.1 and higher, out-of-line atomics are enabled by default. Refer to [Making the most of the Arm architecture with GCC 10](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/tools-software-ides-blog/posts/making-the-most-of-the-arm-architecture-in-gcc-10) for more info. 

**Which CPU or architecture version should I specify with gcc?**

In the [Graviton getting started](https://github.com/aws/aws-graviton-getting-started/blob/main/c-c++.md) on GitHub AWS recommends using
-march=armv8.2-a+fp16+rcpc+dotprod+crypto 
for GCC targeting Graviton2.

It’s generally a good idea to use the latest compiler available on the operating system being used.

**Is LSE built into the C library on my operating system?**

Yes, if you are using any of the operating systems below. Only Ubuntu 18.04 requires an extra package to be installed. 

- Amazon Linux 2
- Amazon Linux 2022
- Ubuntu 18.04 (needs `apt install libc6-lse`)
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ubuntu 22.04
