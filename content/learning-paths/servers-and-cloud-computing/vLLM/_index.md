title: Build and Run a Virtual Large Language Model (vLLM) on Arm Servers

minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers and AI engineers interested in learning how to use a vLLM (Virtual Large Language Model) on Arm servers.

learning_objectives:
    - Build a vLLM from source on an Arm server.
    - Download a Qwen LLM from Hugging Face.
    - Run local batch inference using a vLLM.
    - Create and interact with an OpenAI-compatible server provided by a vLLM on your Arm server.
    
prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider, or a local Arm Linux computer with at least 8 CPUs and 16 GB RAM.
