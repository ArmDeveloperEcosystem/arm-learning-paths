minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to learn how to measure and accelerate the performance of Natural Language Processing (NLP), vision and recommender PyTorch models on Arm-based servers.

learning_objectives:
    - Download and install the PyTorch Benchmarks suite.
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - Evaluate PyTorch model inference performance on an Arm-based server using the PyTorch Benchmark suite.
    - Compare the model inference performance using eager mode and `torch.compile` mode in PyTorch.
=======
    - Evaluate the performance of PyTorch model inference running on your Arm based server using the PyTorch Benchmark suite.
    - Measure the performance of these models using eager and `torch.compile` modes in PyTorch.
>>>>>>> 5f2151168 (Changed model to Tiny Rock–Paper–Scissors CNN)

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider or an on-premise Arm server.
