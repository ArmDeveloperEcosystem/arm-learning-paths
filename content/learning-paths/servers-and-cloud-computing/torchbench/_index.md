title: Accelerate and measure PyTorch Inference on Arm servers

minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to learn how to measure and accelerate the performance of Natural Language Processing (NLP), vision and recommender PyTorch models on Arm-based servers. 

learning_objectives:
    - Download and install the PyTorch Benchmarks suite.
    - Evaluate the performance of PyTorch model inference running on your Arm based server using the PyTorch Benchmark suite.
    - Measure the performance of these models using eager and torch.compile modes in PyTorch.

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider or an on-premise Arm server.
