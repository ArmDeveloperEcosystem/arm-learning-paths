## AWS Graviton2 Arm Instances on Amazon EC2

**AWS Graviton2** is a family of Arm-based processors designed by AWS and built on **Arm Neoverse-N1 cores**. These instances deliver exceptional price-to-performance efficiency, making them ideal for compute-intensive workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, containerized applications, and data processing tasks.

Graviton2-powered EC2 instances provide high performance and energy efficiency compared to traditional x86-based instances while maintaining compatibility with popular Linux distributions and open-source software stacks.

To learn more about AWS Graviton processors, refer to the [AWS Graviton2 Processor Overview](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/).

## CircleCI

**CircleCI** is a leading cloud-based **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)** platform that automates the **building, testing, and deployment** of software projects.

It seamlessly integrates with popular version control systems such as **GitHub**, **Bitbucket**, and **GitLab**, allowing developers to define automation workflows through a `.circleci/config.yml` file written in **YAML syntax**.

CircleCI supports multiple execution environments, including **Docker**, **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**, while providing advanced capabilities like **parallel job execution**, **build caching**, and **matrix builds** for optimized performance.

It is widely adopted by development teams to **accelerate build cycles, enforce code quality, automate testing, and streamline application delivery**.
