## AWS Graviton Arm Instances on Amazon EC2

AWS Graviton is a family of Arm-based processors designed by AWS and built on Arm Neoverse-N1 cores. These instances deliver price-to-performance efficiency, making them suitable for compute-intensive workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, containerized applications, and data processing tasks.

Graviton-powered EC2 instances provide high performance and energy efficiency while maintaining compatibility with popular Linux distributions and open-source software stacks.

## CircleCI

CircleCI is a leading cloud-based Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) platform that automates the building, testing, and deployment of software projects.

It seamlessly integrates with popular version control systems such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab, allowing developers to define automation workflows through a `.circleci/config.yml` file written in YAML syntax.

CircleCI supports multiple execution environments, including Docker, Linux, macOS, and Windows, while providing advanced capabilities like parallel job execution, build caching, and matrix builds for optimized performance.

It is widely adopted by development teams to accelerate build cycles, enforce code quality, automate testing, and streamline application delivery.

Continue to the next section to set up your Graviton instance that you will use to run CircleCI workloads.
