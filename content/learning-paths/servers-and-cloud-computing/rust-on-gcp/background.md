## Google Axion C4A Arm instances in Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Google’s custom Axion CPU, which is based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. Designed for high-performance and energy-efficient computing, these virtual machines offer strong performance for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while leveraging the scalability and performance benefits of the Arm architecture in Google Cloud.

## Rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a modern, high-performance systems programming language designed for safety, speed, and concurrency. It provides memory safety without garbage collection, making it ideal for building reliable and efficient software.

Developed by Mozilla, Rust is widely used in system-level programming, web assembly, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.  
Its strong type system and ownership model help prevent common bugs like data races and memory leaks.
