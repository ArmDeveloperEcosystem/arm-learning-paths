## Deploying LTO

### A simple use-case
To rely on GCC's default configuration for link-time optimization, using the feature is as simple as passing gcc the `-flto` flag when invoking it from the command line.

For the step-wise build of an executable, we'd have:
```sh
gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o
```
This could be simplified to a one-liner, as follows:
```sh
gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c
```

### Modifying LTO behaviour
Link-time optimization may be sped up by execution in parallel - `-flto=<nparallel>` allows us to manually specify the desired number of parallel jobs or `-flto=auto` can be used for automatic parallelization.

During code development, it is possible to cache the outputs of translational units inside LTO, thus significantly shortening edit-compile cycles. This can be achieved using the `-flto-incremental=<path>` flag.
