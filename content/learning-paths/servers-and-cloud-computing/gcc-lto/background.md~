## A Brief Introduction to Link-Time Optimization

Different optimizations carried out by the compiler may be categorized by the scope within which they operate.

Some optimizations such as dead code elimination operate within the limited scope of a single function.  If some defined variable is known not to be used within its scope, it can be thrown away without knowlege of what the program does outside of its scope.

Others, however, require knowlege of the rest of the code.  A function known to be called with a constant as one if its parameters is likely to benefit from interprocedural constant propagation, for example.  Any such optimization must, however, be conservative.

A function not visible outside of the file in which it is defined - its translational unit - will have enough information by default for the compiler to make such decisions.  For a function exposed in a library, on the other hand, it is impossible to make conclusions such as how it will be called at compile-time and such optimizations cannot be made. Between these two extremes lie functions defined for use throughout a program's various components, but whose use will be fully defined once the final executable is defined.

It is for these cases that link-time optimization (LTO) is able to provide executables with maximal performance gains.
