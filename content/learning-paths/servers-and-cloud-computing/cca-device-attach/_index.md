title: Explore secure device attach in Arm CCA Realms

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for developers who want to understand how Arm CCA Realms interact with I/O devices using VirtIO, bounce buffers, and secure device attach mechanisms.

learning_objectives:
    - Define device attach and distinguish VirtIO paravirtualized attach from secure physical device attach
    - Summarize what a Realm is and how RME isolates Realm memory
    - Describe how VirtIO enables paravirtualized I/O without full device emulation
    - Explain when and why SWIOTLB bounce buffers are used in Realms
    - Describe how PCIe‑TDISP and PCIe‑IDE support secure physical device attach and attestation

prerequisites:
    - An AArch64 or x86_64 computer running Linux or macOS. You can also use a cloud instance from one of these [Arm cloud service providers](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/).
    - Completion of [Get Started with CCA Attestation and Veraison](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/cca-veraison) Learning Path
    - Completion of the [Run an application in a Realm using the Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA)](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/cca-container/) Learning Path
    - Completion of the [Run an end-to-end Attestation Flow](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/cca-essentials/) Learning Path
