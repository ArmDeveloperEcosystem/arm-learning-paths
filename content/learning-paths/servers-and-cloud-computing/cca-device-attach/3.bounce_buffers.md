## What are bounce buffers?

Bounce buffers are temporary memory areas used when a device cannot perform DMA on the original buffer. 

Common reasons include:

- The original buffer is not physically contiguous.
- The buffer resides in memory not accessible by the device.
- The buffer does not meet the device alignment or boundary constraints. 

## Why use bounce buffers?

Data *bounces* between:

- The original buffer in user space or kernel space
- The DMA-capable bounce buffer used for device I/O

This indirection allows data transfer to proceed when the original buffer is unsuitable for DMA.

## CCA Realms, VirtIO, and bounce buffers

A defining feature of a Realm is that its memory (Realm memory) is cryptographically isolated from both Normal Secure Worlds: 

This means:

- Realm memory is encrypted with unique keys.
- The host OS and hypervisor cannot directly read or write Realm memory.
- Direct Memory Access (DMA) from peripherals or untrusted drivers cannot access Realm data.

This isolation ensures confidentiality but requires a secure way to exchange data with untrusted components such as host network stacks or storage subsystems. Bounce buffers provide this mechanism.

## How are bounce buffers used with RME?

With RME, Realms use bounce buffers to export and import data.

**Exporting data**:
   - A Realm application prepares data (for example, the results of computation)
   - It copies the data from protected Realm memory into a bounce buffer
   - The Realm notifies the untrusted host or hypervisor
   - The host retrieves the data from the bounce buffer

**Importing data**:
   - The host places data into a bounce buffer
   - The Realm is notified and validates the source
   - The Realm copies the data from the bounce buffer into protected memory

This pattern preserves confidentiality and integrity of Realm data because:

   - The Realm never allows direct access to its memory
   - Incoming data can be validated and sanitized before import
   - Only data explicitly copied out leaves Realm protection

## Does a bounce buffer preserve confidentiality?

A bounce buffer preserves the confidentiality of other Realm data because only the explicitly shared region is exposed. However, the transferred data is outside Realm protection once it leaves. Use protocol-level encryption such as TLS for network traffic to keep that data confidential in transit.

## Next steps

In the next section, you'll test this by tracing SWIOTLB activity in [Exercise: observe bounce buffers in a Realm](./lab-observe-bounce-buffers.md).
