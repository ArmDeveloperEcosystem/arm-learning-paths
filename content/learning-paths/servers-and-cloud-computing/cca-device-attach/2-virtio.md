### FIXED, DO NOT MODIFY

This section provides a high level overview of VirtIO and Bounce Buffers, and how they
relate to CCA Realms.

A Realm has to use physical devices at some point to interact with the external
and or physical world. The easiest way to do this is by using VirtIO, which
provides a fast high level emulation layer. This can be viewed as the first level of
device attach.

More evolved device attach features can be
performed leveraging hardware security features like PCIe-TDISP (**T**EE
**D**evice **I**nterface **S**ecurity **P**rotocol) and PCIe-IDE (**I**ntegrity
and **D**ata **E**ncryption), where the host OS can assign a physical device to
a realm, which will be able to make security measurements on the physical device
and include it in its base and measurements.

## VirtIO

### What is VirtIO ?

VirtIO is an abstraction layer for virtual devices in virtualized environments.
It provides standardized and efficient interfaces between guest virtual machines
(VMs) and host devices, making it easier to develop paravirtualized drivers.
Paravirtualized means that the guest OS is aware it’s running in a virtualized
environment and can use optimized drivers (VirtIO) to communicate with virtual
hardware. Emulating hardware devices (like NICs or disks) for VMs is slow and
inefficient. VirtIO provides a standardized and efficient interface that allows
VMs to bypass full device emulation and instead use optimized drivers.

VirtIO is most commonly used with KVM/QEMU virtualization. Example drivers are:
- `virtio-net`: Paravirtualized networking
- `virtio-blk`: Block device (disk) access
- `virtio-fs`: File sharing (host ↔ guest)
- `virtio-balloon`: Dynamic memory management
- `virtio-rng`: Random number source
- `virtio-console`: Simple console interface
- ...

### How VirtIO works in VMs

Here is an overview of how VirtIO works in Virtual Machines:

1. The Host Hypervisor (e.g., QEMU/KVM) exposes VirtIO “backend” devices.
2. The guest OS loads VirtIO _frontend_ drivers (e.g., `virtio_net`,
   `virtio_blk`) that communicate using the VirtIO protocol.
3. Communication happens via shared memory (`virtqueues`) for I/O operations,
   avoiding full device emulation.
4. Devices are exposed over the PCI or MMIO bus to the guest.

For example, instead of emulating an Intel e1000 NIC, the host exposes a
`virtio-net` interface to the guest OS and the guest OS uses the `virtio-net`
driver to send/receive packets via shared buffers.

## Bounce buffers

### What are bounce buffers?

Bounce buffers are temporary memory buffers used in the Linux kernel to handle situations where direct memory access (DMA) can’t be performed directly on the original data buffer. This often happens because:
1. The original buffer is not physically contiguous.
2. The buffer is in high memory or not accessible to the device.
3. The buffer doesn’t meet alignment or boundary requirements of the device.

### Why bounce buffers?

Data _bounces_ between:
- The original buffer (in user/kernel space) and
- The DMA-capable bounce buffer (used for I/O with the device)

This ensures that data transfers can still happen even when the original memory
is not suitable or accessible for transfers.

## CCA Realms, VirtIO and bounce buffers

The defining feature of a Realm is that its memory (called *Realm memory*) is
cryptographically isolated from both the Normal and Secure Worlds. This means
that:
- Realm memory is encrypted using keys that are unique to each Realm.
- Non-Realm entities (like the host OS or hypervisor) cannot directly read or
  write Realm memory.
- Even Direct Memory Access (DMA) from peripherals or untrusted drivers cannot
  access Realm data.

This design ensures confidentiality but introduces a problem: How can Realms
interact with untrusted components, such as:
- Network stacks in the host OS,
- Storage subsystems,
- I/O devices managed by untrusted drivers?

The solution to safely exchange data between a Realm and the outside World is to
use bounce buffers as an intermediary.

### How bounce buffers are used with RME

1. Exporting Data:
   - A Realm application prepares some data (e.g., results of computation).
   - It copies this data from protected Realm memory into a bounce buffer.
   - The Realm notifies the untrusted host or hypervisor that the data is ready.
   - The host retrieves the data from the bounce buffer.

2. Importing Data:
   - The host places data (e.g., input from a file or device) into a bounce buffer.
   - The Realm is notified and validates the source.
   - The Realm copies the data from the bounce buffer into its protected memory.

This pattern preserves confidentiality and integrity of Realm data, since:
- The Realm never allows direct access to its memory.
- It can validate and sanitize any data received via bounce buffers.
- No sensitive data is exposed without explicit copying.

### Confidentiality preserved with bounce buffers, really?

In the previous section, it was mentioned that bounce buffers preserve
confidentiality. Lets dive a little deeper into that. Bounce buffers
are nothing more than an explicitly shared temporary area between the Realm
world and the outside world. This does indeed preserve the confidentiality of
all the rest of the Realm data. On the other hand, for the data being
transferred, it is leaving the Realm world and will only remain confidential if it
is encrypted in some way, e.g. for network traffic, TLS should be used.

## Seeing a Realm's bounce buffers at work

Let's put this to work and check for ourselves that bounce buffers are used. The
steps in this section will build on the Key Broker demo that was used in the [CCA
Essentials learning path](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/cca-essentials/example/),
demonstrating an end-to-end attestation.

### Start the Key Broker Server (KBS)

First, pull the docker container image with the pre-built KBS, and then run the container:

```bash
docker pull armswdev/cca-learning-path:cca-key-broker-v2 
docker run --rm -it armswdev/cca-learning-path:cca-key-broker-v2
```

Now within your running docker container, get a list of network interfaces:

```bash
ip -c a
```

The output should look like:

```output
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
20: eth0@if21: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.17.0.2/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Start the KBS on the `eth0` network interface, and replace 172.17.0.2 shown in
the command below with the IP address corresponding to eth0 in the output of `ip
-c a` above.

```bash
./keybroker-server -v --addr 172.17.0.2
```

The output should look like:

```output
INFO starting 16 workers
INFO Actix runtime found; starting in Actix runtime
INFO starting service: "actix-web-service-172.17.0.2:8088", workers: 16, listening on: 172.17.0.2:8088
```

### Get into a Realm

With the Key Broker Server running in one terminal, open up a new terminal in
which you will run the Key Broker Client (KBC). The intent is to
observe that the data transmitted over the network (thru `virtio_net`) are
indeed using bounce buffers.

Pull the docker container image with the pre-built KBC, and then run the container:

```bash
docker pull armswdev/cca-learning-path:cca-simulation-v2
docker run --rm -it armswdev/cca-learning-path:cca-simulation-v2
```

Within the running container, launch the `run-cca-fvp.sh` script to run the Arm
CCA pre-built binaries on the FVP:

```bash
./run-cca-fvp.sh
```
The `run-cca-fvp.sh` script uses the screen command to connect to the different
UARTs in the FVP.

You should see the host Linux kernel boot on your terminal and you will be
prompted to log in to the host. Enter root as the username:

```output

[    4.273748] EXT4-fs (vda): re-mounted 64d1bcff-5d03-412c-83c6-48ec4253590e r/w. Quota mode: none.

deleting routers
adding dns 172.20.51.254
OK

Welcome to the CCA host
host login: root
(host) #
```

Change directory to `/cca` and use `lkvm` to launch a guest Linux in a Realm:
```bash
cd /cca
./lkvm run --realm --disable-sve --irqchip=gicv3-its --firmware KVMTOOL_EFI.fd -c 1 -m 512 --no-pvtime --disk guest-disk.img --restricted_mem --virtio-transport pci --pmu --network mode=user
```

You should see the realm boot. Note that `lkvm` is invoked with `--network
mode=user`, which makes the guest see the network through a VirtIO device.

After boot up, which might take some time, you will be prompted to log in at the
guest Linux prompt. Use root again as the username:

```output
Starting syslogd: OK
Starting klogd: OK
Running sysctl: OK
Starting network: udhcpc: started, v1.36.1

udhcpc: broadcasting select for 192.168.33.15, server 192.168.33.1

deleting routers
adding dns 172.20.51.254
OK

Welcome to the CCA realm
realm login: root

```

### Observe bounce buffer usage in the realm

First, check that the Linux kernel has tracing support:

```bash { output_lines="2-46" }

i2c                      qcom_aoss
```

As shown above, you should see a list of the available trace
points.

Now, enable the kernel tracing infrastructure together with bounce buffer
tracing, read the trace in the background (filtering on `keybroker-app-`) and
run the Key Broker Client application in the realm, using the endpoint address
that the Key Broker Server is listening on (from the other terminal):

```bash
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_on
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/swiotlb/enable
grep keybroker-app- /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe &
keybroker-app -v --endpoint http://172.17.0.2:8088 skywalker
```

In the `keybroker-app`command above, `skywalker` is the key name that is
requested from the KBS.

The output should look like:

```output
INFO Requesting key named 'skywalker' from the keybroker server with URL http://172.17.0.2:8088/keys/v1/key/skywalker
INFO Challenge (64 bytes) = [5c, ec, 1e, f5, 93, 54, 4a, 8a, ee, 2e, 46, a0, 50, 0d, 41, dd, d4, 60, b0, 58, 5b, 51, 71, 76, d1, 66, d3, b7, 38, e8, af, ae, 0a, 07, 4e, c5, 60, dc, 4a, c0, b8, 73, 98, d9, bd, af, 41, 96, 99, 6d, 74, cc, 19, 70, 24, c4, c9, 5c, 21, 61, 1a, cb, 76, 75]

```

Note that the interleaving of the trace messages and KBC messages might differ
from one run to another. With the `switlb_bounced` messages above you can successfully observe that the bounce buffers are being used in the realm.
