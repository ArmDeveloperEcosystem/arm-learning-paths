## See a Realm's bounce buffers in action

In this exercise, youâ€™ll run the CCA Key Broker demo inside a Realm and use kernel tracing to confirm that bounce buffers (SWIOTLB) are used for VirtIO network I/O. You will confirm bounce buffer usage using the Key Broker demo from the [CCA Essentials Learning Path](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/cca-essentials/example/).

## Start the Key Broker server (KBS)

Pull the Docker container image with the pre-built KBS, and run the container:

```bash
docker pull armswdev/cca-learning-path:cca-key-broker-v2 
docker run --rm -it armswdev/cca-learning-path:cca-key-broker-v2
```

List network interfaces:

```bash
ip -c a
```

The output should look like:

```output
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
20: eth0@if21: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.17.0.2/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Start the KBS on `eth0` using the address from your output:

```bash
./keybroker-server -v --addr 172.17.0.2
```

The output should look like:

```output
INFO starting 16 workers
INFO Actix runtime found; starting in Actix runtime
INFO starting service: "actix-web-service-172.17.0.2:8088", workers: 16, listening on: 172.17.0.2:8088
```

## Get into a Realm guest

With the Key Broker Server running in one terminal, open up a new terminal in
which you will run the Key Broker Client (KBC). The intent is to confirm that the data transmitted over the network (through `virtio_net`) are indeed using bounce buffers.

Pull the Docker container image with the pre-built KBC, and then run the container:

```bash
docker pull armswdev/cca-learning-path:cca-simulation-v2
docker run --rm -it armswdev/cca-learning-path:cca-simulation-v2
```

Launch the Arm CCA prebuilt binaries on the FVP:

```bash
./run-cca-fvp.sh
```
The script connects to the FVP UARTs. When the host Linux kernel finishes booting, log in as root:

```output

OK

Welcome to the CCA host
host login: root
(host) #
```

Change directory to `/cca` and launch a Realm guest with `lkvm`:

```bash
cd /cca
./lkvm run --realm --disable-sve --irqchip=gicv3-its --firmware KVMTOOL_EFI.fd -c 1 -m 512 --no-pvtime --disk guest-disk.img --restricted_mem --virtio-transport pci --pmu --network mode=user
```

You should see the realm boot. Note that `lkvm` is invoked with `--network mode=user`, which makes the guest see the network through a VirtIO device.

After boot, which might take some time, you will be prompted to log in at the guest Linux prompt. Use root again as the username:

```output

As shown above, you should see a list of the available trace points.

Now, enable the kernel tracing infrastructure together with bounce buffer tracing, read the trace in the background (filtering on `keybroker-app-`) and run the Key Broker Client application in the realm, using the endpoint address that the Key Broker Server is listening on (from the other terminal):

```bash
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_on
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/swiotlb/enable
grep keybroker-app- /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe &
keybroker-app -v --endpoint http://172.17.0.2:8088 skywalker
```

In the `keybroker-app` command above, `skywalker` is the key name that is requested from the KBS.

The output should look like:

```output

INFO Challenge (64 bytes) = [5c, ec, 1e, f5, 93, 54, 4a, 8a, ee, 2e, 46, a0, 50, 0d, 41, dd, d4, 60, b0, 58, 5b, 51, 71, 76, d1, 66, d3, b7, 38, e8, af, ae, 0a, 07, 4e, c5, 60, dc, 4a, c0, b8, 73, 98, d9, bd, af, 41, 96, 99, 6d, 74, cc, 19, 70, 24, c4, c9, 5c, 21, 61, 1a, cb, 76, 75]

```

Note that the interleaving of the trace messages and KBC messages might differ from one run to another. The `swiotlb_bounced` events confirm that bounce buffers are being used in the Realm.
