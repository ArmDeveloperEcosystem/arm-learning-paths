Armâ€™s *Realm Management Extension (RME)* is a key security feature introduced in
the Armv9-A architecture. It enables a new form of hardware-enforced isolation
designed to support Confidential Computing. It defines the set of hardware
features and properties that are required to comply with the Arm's Confidential
Computing Architecture (CCA) architecture.

At the heart of RME is the concept of a Realm, a protected execution
environment that operates independently from the conventional Normal World
(used by operating systems and applications) and the Secure World (used by
trusted firmware or TEE). Realms are managed by a new privileged entity called
the Realm Management Monitor (RMM) and are enforced by the hardware via the
Granule Protection Table (GPT) and Granule Transitioning mechanism.

Realms allow lower-privileged software, such as an application or a virtual
machine, to protect its content and execution from attacks by higher-privileged
software, such as an OS or a hypervisor. Realms provide an environment for
confidential computing, without requiring the Realm owner to trust the software
components that manage the resources that the Realm uses.

To be useful, a Realm has to interact with the rest of the world at some point.
For example, a network interface is likely to be needed. This learning path will
show you how devices are attached and used by Realms.
