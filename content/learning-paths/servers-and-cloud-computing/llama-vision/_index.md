title: Deploy a LLM-based Vision Chatbot with PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers on Google Axion processors

minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for software developers and ML engineers who are interested in deploying a production-ready vision chatbot for their application with optimized performance on the Arm Architecture.

learning_objectives:
    - Build a frontend with Streamlit to input images and prompts.
    - Build the backend to download a Llama 3.2-Vision model, quantize it, and run it using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.
    - Monitor and analyze inference on Arm CPUs.

prerequisites:
    - A Google Cloud Axion compute instance or [any Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider with at least 32 cores.
    - Familiarity with REST APIs and web services.
    - A basic understanding of Python and ML concepts.
    - A basic understanding of Streamlit.
    - A basic understanding of LLM fundamentals.
