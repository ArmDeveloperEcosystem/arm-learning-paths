## Google Axion C4A instances on Google Cloud

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines powered by Google's custom Axion CPU, which is built on Arm Neoverse V2 cores. Designed for high performance and energy efficiency, these VMs are well-suited for modern cloud workloads such as CI/CD pipelines, microservices, media processing, and general-purpose applications.

The C4A series can provide a cost-efficient alternative to x86 VMs while leveraging the scalability and performance characteristics of the Arm architecture on Google Cloud.

For further information, see the Google blog [Introducing Google Axion Processors, our new Arm-based CPUs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu).

## Buildkite for CI/CD on Arm

Buildkite is a flexible and scalable continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) platform that enables you to run pipelines on your own infrastructure. By deploying Buildkite agents on Google Axion C4A VMs, you can take advantage of Arm's performance and cost efficiency to build, test, and deploy applications, including multi-architecture Docker images.

Buildkite integrates seamlessly with version control systems such as GitHub and supports advanced workflows for cloud migration, multi-arch builds, and testing microservices. Learn more in the [Buildkite documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs).
