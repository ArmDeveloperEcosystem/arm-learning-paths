## What you'll do in this section

In this section, you'll configure and connect a Buildkite agent on a Google Axion C4A Arm virtual machine (VM). You'll generate an agent token, set up the agent configuration, create a Buildkite queue, and verify that your agent is online and ready to run CI/CD jobs on Arm infrastructure.

## Create an agent token

Before configuring the agent, you need an agent token from your Buildkite organization.

To create an agent token, follow these steps:

- Sign in to your Buildkite account. You can use your GitHub credentials if you prefer.
- In the left menu, select **Organization settings**.
- Select **Agents**.
- Select **Create agent token**.
- Enter a descriptive name for the token, such as `buildkite-arm`.
- Select **Create token**.
- Copy the token and store it securely as you wonâ€™t be able to view it again after you leave the page.

## Configure the Buildkite agent

Create the configuration directory and file on your local system with the commands below:

```console
sudo tee /root/.buildkite-agent/buildkite-agent.cfg > /dev/null <<EOF
token="YOUR_AGENT_TOKEN"
tags="queue=buildkite-queue1"
EOF
```

Replace `YOUR_AGENT_TOKEN` with the token that you generated from your Buildkite Agents page.  

{{% notice Tip %}}
You might find it easier to copy the commands above into a text file named `config-agent.sh` and run the file.
```console
bash ./config-agent.sh
```
{{% /notice %}}

In Buildkite `tags` are key-value labels that let you match pipeline steps to specific agents, ensuring jobs run only on agents with the required tag.

The `name` field is optional; if omitted, Buildkite will assign a default name.


Verify the configuration:

```console
sudo cat /root/.buildkite-agent/buildkite-agent.cfg
```

You should see output similar to:

```output
# The token from your Buildkite "Agents" page
token="YOUR-GENERATED-TOKEN-VALUE"
tags="queue=buildkite-queue1"
```

## Create a queue in Buildkite

Now that your agent is created, you can create a queue. 

- Go to your Buildkite organization, select **Queues**, and then select **Create queue**.
- Enter a name for the queue, for example `buildkite-queue1`.
- Select **Save** to create the queue.

This step connects your agent to the correct queue, ensuring jobs are routed to your Arm-based Buildkite agent.

{{% notice Note %}}
Make sure the queue name matches the `tags` field in the agent configuration.
{{% /notice %}}

## Verify the agent in the Buildkite UI

First, start the agent on your local computer: 

```console
sudo /root/.buildkite-agent/bin/buildkite-agent start --build-path="/var/lib/buildkite-agent/builds"
```

Then, confirm the agent is visible in the Buildkite UI, by doing the following:

- In the Buildkite dashboard, select **Agents** from the left menu. This page lists all registered agents for your organization. 
- Look for your new agent in the list and verify that its status is **online** and that it is assigned to the correct queue.

Confirm that the agent is online and connected to the queue `buildkite-queue1`.

Congratulations! Your Buildkite agent is now set up and connected to your queue. You can now start using Buildkite to build multi-architecture images on your Arm-based VM. This setup enables you to run CI/CD pipelines optimized for Arm platforms, and take advantage of the performance and scalability of Arm servers.
