# Set up a Buildkite agent

After installing the Buildkite agent binary on a Google Axion C4A Arm VM, you can set up and configure a Buildkite agent and queue.

## Create an agent token

Before configuring the agent, you need an agent token from your Buildkite organization.

To create an agent token, follow these steps:

- Sign in to your Buildkite account. You can use your GitHub credentials if you prefer.
- In the left menu, select **Organization settings**.
- Select **Agents**.
- Select **Create agent token**.
- Enter a descriptive name for the token, such as `buildkite-arm`.
- Select **Create token**.
- Copy the token and store it securely as you wonâ€™t be able to view it again after you leave the page.

## Configure Buildkite Agent

Create the configuration directory and file on your local system with the commands below:

```console
sudo tee /root/.buildkite-agent/buildkite-agent.cfg > /dev/null <<EOF
token="YOUR_AGENT_TOKEN"
tags="queue=buildkite-queue1"
EOF
```

Replace `YOUR_AGENT_TOKEN` with the token that you generated from your Buildkite Agents page.  

{{% notice Tip %}}
You might find it easier to copy the commands above into a text file named `config-agent.sh` and run the file.
```console
bash ./config-agent.sh
```
{{% /notice %}}

In Buildkite `tags` are key-value labels that let you match pipeline steps to specific agents, ensuring jobs run only on agents with the required tag.

The `name` field is optional; if omitted, Buildkite will assign a default name.


Verify the configuration:

```console
sudo cat /root/.buildkite-agent/buildkite-agent.cfg
```

You should see output similar to:

```output
# The token from your Buildkite "Agents" page
token="YOUR-GENERATED-TOKEN-VALUE"
tags="queue=buildkite-queue1"
```

## Create a Queue in Buildkite

Now that your agent is created, you can create a queue. 

- Go to your Buildkite organization, select **Queues**, and then select **Create queue**.
- Enter a name for the queue, for example `buildkite-queue1`.
- Select **Save** to create the queue.

This step connects your agent to the correct queue, ensuring jobs are routed to your Arm-based Buildkite agent.

{{% notice Note %}}
Make sure the queue name matches the `tags` field in the agent configuration.
{{% /notice %}}

## Verify the agent in the Buildkite UI

First, start the agent on your local computer: 

```console
sudo /root/.buildkite-agent/bin/buildkite-agent start --build-path="/var/lib/buildkite-agent/builds"
```

Then, confirm it is visible in the Buildkite UI:

Go Buildkite and select Agents

Confirm that the agent is online and connected to the queue `buildkite-queue1`.

The Buildkite agent is ready, you can proceed to use Buildkite for building multi-arch images.
