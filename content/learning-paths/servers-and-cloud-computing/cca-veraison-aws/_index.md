title: Build a CCA Attestation Service in AWS with Veraison

draft: true
cascade:
    draft: true

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for developers who understand the basics of CCA attestation and the Veraison project, and who wish to progress onto creating a more scalable deployment of a CCA attestation verifier service in the cloud.


learning_objectives:
    - Create an attestation service in the AWS cloud using components from the Veraison project.
    - Prepare the Veraison service to act as a verifier for Arm CCA attestation tokens by provisioning CCA platform endorsements.


prerequisites:
    - An [AWS account](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/aws/) for accessing AWS cloud services.
    - An x86 computer running Ubuntu or Arch Linux, which is authorized to use the AWS account. Other build environments might be possible, but will require the configuration of toolchains for cross-compilation.
