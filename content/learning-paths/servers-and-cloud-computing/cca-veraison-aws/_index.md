title: Build a CCA Attestation Service on AWS with Veraison

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for developers familiar with CCA attestation and the Veraison project. You'll learn how to deploy a scalable CCA attestation verifier service on AWS.

learning_objectives:
    - Build an attestation service on AWS using the Veraison project's components.
    - Set up Veraison as a verifier for Arm CCA attestation tokens by provisioning CCA platform endorsements.

prerequisites:
    - An [AWS account](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/aws/) with access to AWS services.
    - An x86 computer running Ubuntu or Arch Linux, authorized for AWS access. If you're using another build environment, you'll need to configure the toolchains for cross-compilation.
