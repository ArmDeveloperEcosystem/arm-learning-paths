## Overview

This section introduces the Google Axion C4A Arm platform and ClickHouse, providing the context you need before provisioning and deploying ClickHouse on Arm-based Google Cloud virtual machines.

## Explore Google Axion C4A Arm instances

Google Axion C4A is a family of Arm-based virtual machines built on Google's custom Axion CPU, based on Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. These virtual machines are designed for running performance-sensitive workloads on Google Cloud using the Arm architecture.

For database and analytics use cases, the C4A series provides a cost-effective alternative to x86 virtual machines while maintaining compatibility with modern Linux software stacks.

## Explore ClickHouse

ClickHouse is an open-source, columnar OLAP database designed for high-performance analytics and real-time reporting, using vectorized execution and columnar storage to process large datasets efficiently.

ClickHouse runs efficiently on Arm-based platforms, including AWS Graviton and Google Cloud Arm virtual machines, making it a suitable candidate for evaluation on Google Axion C4A instances.
