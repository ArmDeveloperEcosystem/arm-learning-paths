title: Code level Performance Analysis using PMUv3_plugin 

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: Engineers working on a workload/codebase to carry out performance analysis at code block level.

learning_objectives: 
    - Get a fine-grained and precise measurement of functions or chunk of code handling a specific task. 
    - Instrument at a code/function level by choosing one of the 4 scenarios detailed in this learning path. 
    - Run and collect the performance metrics as well as raw event values of 15 groups/bundles of PMUs in one shot.
    - Use the backend tool to plot raw PMU event values along with the KPI/metric values like MPKI, stalls, IPC and many more, thus helping in performance analysis tasks. 

prerequisites:
    - Some familiarity with performance analysis.
