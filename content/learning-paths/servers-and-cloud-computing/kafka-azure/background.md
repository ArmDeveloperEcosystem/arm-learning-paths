## Cobalt 100 Arm-based processor

Azure’s Cobalt 100 is built on Microsoft's first-generation, in-house Arm-based processor: the Cobalt 100. Designed entirely by Microsoft and based on Arm’s Neoverse N2 architecture, this 64-bit CPU delivers improved performance and energy efficiency across a broad spectrum of cloud-native, scale-out Linux workloads. These include web and application servers, data analytics, open-source databases, caching systems, and more. Running at 3.4 GHz, the Cobalt 100 processor allocates a dedicated physical core for each virtual CPU (vCPU), ensuring consistent and predictable performance. 

To learn more about Cobalt 100, refer to the blog [Announcing the preview of new Azure virtual machine based on the Azure Cobalt 100 processor](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurecompute/announcing-the-preview-of-new-azure-vms-based-on-the-azure-cobalt-100-processor/4146353).

## Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is a high-performance, open-source distributed event streaming platform designed for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

It allows you to publish, subscribe to, store, and process streams of records in a fault-tolerant and scalable manner. Kafka stores data in topics, which are partitioned and replicated across a cluster to ensure durability and high availability.

Kafka is widely used for messaging, log aggregation, event sourcing, real-time analytics, and integrating large-scale data systems. Learn more from the [Apache Kafka official website](https://kafka.apache.org/) and the [Apache Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation).
