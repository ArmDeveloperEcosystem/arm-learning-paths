who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is designed for software developers looking to migrate their Kafka workloads from x86_64 to Arm-based platforms, specifically on the Microsoft Azure Cobalt 100 processors.

learning_objectives: 
    - Provision an Azure Arm64 virtual machine using Azure console, with Ubuntu Pro 24.04 LTS as the base image.
    - Deploy Kafka on the Ubuntu virtual machine.
    - Perform Kafka baseline testing and benchmarking on both x86_64 and Arm64 virtual machines.

prerequisites:
    - A [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account with access to Cobalt 100 based instances (Dpsv6). 
    - Basic understanding of Linux command line.
