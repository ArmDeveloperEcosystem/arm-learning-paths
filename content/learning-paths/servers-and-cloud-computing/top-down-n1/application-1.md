## Example application: DynamoRIO stride benchmark

The white paper presents a micro-benchmark from the DynamoRIO project. The stride benchmark is a pointer chasing algorithm that accesses values in a 16 MB array, with the array position being determined by the pointer being chased. The pointer position is a function of a constant value set in the array before the pointer chasing function begins.

The original source code is at https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/blob/master/clients/drcachesim/tests/stride_benchmark.cpp

The code below is slightly modified to increase the number of iterations so that it runs longer for performance analysis. 

1. Use a text editor to copy the code below into a text file named `stride.cpp`:

    // reordered with respect to callers.
    MEM_BARRIER();

    int position = 0;

    // Here the code will pointer chase through the array skipping forward
    // kStride cache lines at a time. Since kStride is an odd number, the main
    // loop will touch different cache lines as it wraps around.
    for (int loop = 0; loop < kIterations; ++loop) {
        #if defined(ENABLE_PREFETCH) && defined (DIST)
            const int prefetch_distance = DIST * kStride * kLineSize;

    // reordered with respect to callers.
    MEM_BARRIER();

    std::cerr << "Value = " << position << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```


2. Compile the application:

```console
g++ -g -O3 stride.cpp -o stride
```

Using `-g` provides source code information later for `perf report`.

3. Run the application:

```console
./stride
```

The program runs for about 10-20 seconds, depending on your hardware, and the expected output is:

```output
Value = 12779520
```

The next section demonstrates how to collect metrics for performance analysis.
