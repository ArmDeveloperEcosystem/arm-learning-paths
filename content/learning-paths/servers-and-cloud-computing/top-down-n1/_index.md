title: Learn the Arm Neoverse N1 performance analysis methodology

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to learn about performance analysis methodology for Linux applications running on Arm Neoverse.

learning_objectives:
    - Understand sampling and counting for performance analysis
    - Learn commonly used hardware metrics
    - Analyze a sample application using the Arm Telemetry Solution and Linux Perf
    - Make an application code change and see improved performance

prerequisites:
    - An Arm Neoverse N1 computer running Linux. A bare metal or cloud metal instance is best because they expose more counters. You can use a virtual machine (VM), but it may offer fewer counters and some commands might not succeed. These instructions have been tested on the `a1.metal` instance type.
