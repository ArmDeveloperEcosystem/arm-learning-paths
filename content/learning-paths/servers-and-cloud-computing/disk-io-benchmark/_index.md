title: Microbenchmark storage performance with fio on Arm

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers looking to optimize storage performance, reduce costs, identify bottlenecks, and evaluate storage options when migrating applications across platforms.

learning_objectives: 
    - Describe data flow through storage devices.
    - Monitor storage performance using tools like iostat, iotop, and pidstat.
    - Run fio to microbenchmark a block storage device.

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider or an Arm Linux server.
    - Familiarity with Linux.
