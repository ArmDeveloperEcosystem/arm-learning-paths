## Install fio

You can use the same `t4g.medium` instance from the previous section with two different types of SSD-based block storage devices as shown in the console screenshot below. 

### Attach and Identify Block Devices
To add the required EBS volumes to your EC2 instance:

1. In the AWS Console, navigate to **EC2** > **Volumes** > **Create Volume**.

2. Create a volume with the following settings:
   - Volume Type: io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD).
   - Size: 8 GiB.
   - IOPS: 400.
   - Availability Zone: The same as your EC2 instance

3. Create another volume with the following settings:
   - Volume Type: gp2 (General Purpose SSD).
   - Size: 8 GiB.
   - Availability Zone: The same as your EC2 instance.

4. Once created, select each volume and choose **Actions** > **Attach Volume**.

5. Select your t4g.medium instance from the dropdown and attach each volume.

Both block devices have the same 8 GiB capacity, but the `io2` is optimized for throughput, while `gp2` is general-purpose.

In this section, you’ll measure real-world performance to help guide your storage selection.

Flexible I/O (fio) is a command-line tool to generate a synthetic workload with specific I/O characteristics. This serves as a simpler alternative to full record and replay testing. 

Fio is available through most Linux distribution packages, see the [documentation](https://github.com/axboe/fio) for package availability.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fio -y
```

Confirm installation with the following command: 

```bash
fio --version
```

The version is printed:

```output
fio-3.37
```

## Identify Device Names for Benchmarking

Fio allows you to microbenchmark either the block device or a mounted filesystem. Use the disk free, `df` command to confirm your EBS volumes are not mounted. Writing to drives containing critical data can result in data loss. In this tutorial, you're writing to blank, unmounted block devices.

Use the `lsblk` command to view the EBS volumes attached to the server (`nvme1n1` and `nvme2n1`). The immediate number appended to `nvme`, e.g., `nvme0`, shows it is a physically separate device. `nvme1n1` corresponds to the faster `io2` block device and `nvme2n1` corresponds to the slower `gp2` block device. 

```bash
lsblk -e 7
```

```output
NAME         MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
nvme1n1      259:0    0    8G  0 disk 
nvme0n1      259:1    0    8G  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1  259:3    0    7G  0 part /
├─nvme0n1p15 259:4    0   99M  0 part /boot/efi
└─nvme0n1p16 259:5    0  923M  0 part /boot
nvme2n1      259:2    0    8G  0 disk 
```

{{% notice Note%}}
If you have more than one block volume attached to an instance, the `sudo nvme list` command from the `nvme-cli` package can be used to differentiate between volumes

## Generating a synthetic workload

Let’s define a synthetic workload that mimics the behavior of a logging application, using metrics observed earlier.

{{% notice Workload%}}
This workload involves light, sequential reads and writes. The system write throughput per thread is 5 MB/s with 83% writes. There are infrequent bursts of reads for approximately 5 seconds, operating at up to 16MB/s per thread. The workload can scale the infrequent reads and writes to use up to 16 threads each. The block size for the writes and reads are 64KiB and 256KiB respectively (as opposed to the standard 4KiB Page size). 

Further, the application is latency sensitive and given it holds critical information, needs to write directly to non-volatile storage through direct IO. 
{{% /notice %}}

The fio tool uses simple configuration files - called `jobfiles` - to describe the characteristics of your synthetic workload. Parameters under the `[global]` option are shared among jobs. From the example below, you can create 2 jobs to represent the steady write and infrequent reads. Please refer to the official [documentation](https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fio_doc.html#job-file-format) for more details. 

### Create fio Job Files


Create two job files, one for each device, by copying the configuration below and adjusting the filename parameter (`/dev/nvme1n1` or `/dev/nvme2n1`):

```ini
 ; -- start job file including.fio --
[global]
ioengine=libaio
direct=1 ; write directly to the drive
time_based
runtime=30
group_reporting=1
log_avg_msec=1000
rate=16m,5m ; limit to 16 MB/s and 5MB/s for read and write per job
numjobs=${NUM_JOBS} ; set at the command line
iodepth=${IO_DEPTH} ; set at the command line
filename=/dev/nvme1n1 ; or nvme2n1

[steady_write]
name=steady_write
rw=write ; sequential write
bs=64k ; Block size of 64KiB (default block size of 4 KiB)

[burst_read]
name=burst_read
rw=read
bs=256k ; Block size of 256KiB for reads (default is 4KiB)
startdelay=25 ; simulate a 5-second read burst at the end of a 30-second window
runtime=5
; -- end job file including.fio --
```
## Run the Benchmarks


{{% notice Note %}}
Running fio directly on block devices requires root privileges (hence the use of `sudo`). Be careful: writing to the wrong device can result in data loss. Always ensure you are targeting a blank, unmounted device.
{{% /notice %}}



Run the following commands to execute each test sequentially:

```bash
sudo NUM_JOBS=16 IO_DEPTH=64 fio nvme1.fio
```

Then run again with the following command:

```bash
sudo NUM_JOBS=16 IO_DEPTH=64 fio nvme2.fio 
```

### Interpreting Results

The final terminal output from both runs are shown below. 

```output
nvme1:

Run status group 0 (all jobs):
   READ: bw=118MiB/s (124MB/s), 118MiB/s-118MiB/s (124MB/s-124MB/s), io=629MiB (660MB), run=5324-5324msec
  WRITE: bw=80.0MiB/s (83.9MB/s), 80.0MiB/s-80.0MiB/s (83.9MB/s-83.9MB/s), io=2400MiB (2517MB), run=30006-30006msec

Disk stats (read/write):
  nvme1n1: ios=2663/38225, sectors=1294480/4892800, merge=0/0, ticks=148524/454840, in_queue=603364, util=62.19%

nvme2:

Run status group 0 (all jobs):
   READ: bw=85.6MiB/s (89.8MB/s), 85.6MiB/s-85.6MiB/s (89.8MB/s-89.8MB/s), io=456MiB (478MB), run=5322-5322msec
  WRITE: bw=60.3MiB/s (63.2MB/s), 60.3MiB/s-60.3MiB/s (63.2MB/s-63.2MB/s), io=1816MiB (1904MB), run=30119-30119msec

Disk stats (read/write):
  nvme2n1: ios=1872/28855, sectors=935472/3693440, merge=0/0, ticks=159753/1025104, in_queue=1184857, util=89.83%
```

{{% notice Note%}}
fio reports bandwidth in MiB/s (mebibytes per second). MB/s (megabytes per second) is included for comparison. 1 MiB = 1,048,576 bytes, while 1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes.
{{% /notice %}}

Here you can see that the faster `io2` block storage (`nvme1`) is able to meet the throughput requirement of 80MB/s for steady writes when all 16 write threads are running (5MB/s per thread). However, `gp2` saturates at 60.3 MiB/s with over 89.8% SSD utilization. 

Suppose your fictional logging application is sensitive to operation latency. The output below highlights that over ~35% of operations have a latency above 1s on nvme2 compared to ~7% on nvme1. High latency percentiles can significantly impact application responsiveness, especially for latency-sensitive workloads like logging.

```output

  nvme2:

  lat (usec)   : 10=0.01%, 500=1.53%, 750=5.13%, 1000=7.55%
  lat (msec)   : 2=29.49%, 4=0.89%, 10=0.09%, 20=0.02%, 50=0.21%
  lat (msec)   : 100=0.56%, 250=1.84%, 500=6.39%, 750=9.76%, 1000=10.17%
  lat (msec)   : 2000=19.59%, >=2000=6.77%

  nvme1:

  lat (usec)   : 750=0.44%, 1000=0.41%
  lat (msec)   : 2=62.63%, 4=1.12%, 10=0.34%, 20=1.61%, 50=3.91%
  lat (msec)   : 100=2.34%, 250=5.91%, 500=8.46%, 750=4.33%, 1000=2.50%
  lat (msec)   : 2000=3.62%, >=2000=2.38%
```

These insights suggest the SSD designed for throughput, `io2`, is more suitable than the general purpose `gp2` storage to meet the requirements of your logging application.

{{% notice Tip%}}
If the text output is hard to follow, you can use the `fio2gnuplot` package to plot the data graphically or use the visualizations available from your cloud service provider's dashboard. See image below for an example.

The insights gathered by microbenchmarking with fio above can lead to more informed decisions about which block storage to connect to your Arm-based instance.
