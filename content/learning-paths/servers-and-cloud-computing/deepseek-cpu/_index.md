title: Deploy DeepSeek-R1 on Arm Servers with llama.cpp

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for developers who want to run DeepSeek-R1 on Arm-based servers. 

learning_objectives:
    - Clone and build llama.cpp on your Arm-based server.
    - Download a pre-quantized DeepSeek-R1 model from Hugging Face.
    - Run the model on your Arm CPU and benchmark its performance.

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud provider or an on-premise Arm server. This Learning Path was tested on an AWS Graviton4 r8g.24xlarge instance.
