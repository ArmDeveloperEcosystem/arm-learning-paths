title: Create an Azure Linux 3.0 virtual machine with Cobalt 100 processors

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for developers who want to run Azure Linux 3.0 on Arm-based Cobalt 100 processors in a custom virtual machine.


learning_objectives:
  - Use QEMU to create a raw disk image
  - Boot a virtual machine using an AArch64 ISO and install Azure Linux 3.0
  - Convert the raw disk image to VHD format
  - Upload the VHD file to Azure
  - Use Azure Shared Image Gallery (SIG) to create a custom image
  - Create an Azure Linux 3.0 virtual machine on Arm using the Azure CLI and the custom image

prerequisites:
    - A [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account with permission to create resources, including instances using Cobalt 100 processors
    - A Linux machine with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/) and the [Azure CLI](/install-guides/azure-cli/) installed and authenticated
