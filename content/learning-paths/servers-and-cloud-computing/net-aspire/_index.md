title: Run a .NET Aspire application on Arm-based VMs on AWS and GCP

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in learning how to deploy .NET Aspire applications on Arm-based virtual machines (VMs) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

learning_objectives: 
    - Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of .NET Aspire developer tools.
    - Create a .NET Aspire application.
    - Modify code on a Windows on Arm development machine.
    - Deploy a .NET Aspire application to Arm-powered virtual machines in the Cloud.
prerequisites:
    - A Windows on Arm machine, for example the [Windows Dev Kit 2023](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/dev-kit), or a Lenovo Thinkpad X13s running Windows 11 to build the .NET Aspire project.    
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from AWS or GCP.
    - Any code editor. [Visual Studio Code for Arm64](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win32arm64user) is an example of a suitable editor.
