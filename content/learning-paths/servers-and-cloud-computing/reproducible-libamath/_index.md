title: Use reproducible functions in Libamath (Arm Performance Libraries)

minutes_to_complete: 10
author: Joana Cruz

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who want to produce reproducible code across vector extensions using math functions in Libamath, a component of Arm Performance Libraries. 

learning_objectives: 
    - Explain what numerical reproducibility means in numerical software
    - Describe generic applications of numerical reproducibility in the industry
    - Understand how reproducibility is defined in Libamath
    - Enable and use reproducible Libamath functions in real applications

prerequisites:
    - An Arm computer running Linux with [Arm Performance Libraries](/install-guides/armpl/) version 26.01 or newer installed.
