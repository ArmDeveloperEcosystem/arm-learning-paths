## What is ThirdAI?

ThirdAI is a multi-purpose library that provides a high-level API to build machine learning models.

It provides APIs to support common machine learning problems, such as:
- Text classification and NLP (Natural Language Processing).
- Search and recommendation.
- Time-series forecasting and predictions.
- Tabular classification. 
- Graph classification.

## Learning Path Overview

This Learning Path shows you how to use ThirdAI's library for *text classification* tasks on your Arm servers.

Specifically, the Learning Path shows you how to perform the following tasks:

- Download a sentiment classification dataset using the Hugging Face `datasets` library.
- Format the data for the model to understand.
- Create a UniversalDeepTransformer, and configure it for text classification.
- Train the model and print the training metrics.
- Save the model to `sentiment_analysis.model` for further deployment.
