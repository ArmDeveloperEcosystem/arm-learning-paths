title: Run a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model from Hugging Face on Arm servers

minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to learn how to run a NLP model from Hugging Face using PyTorch on Arm based servers. 

learning_objectives:
    - Deploy a PyTorch NLP model from Hugging face on an Arm Neoverse CPU
    - Use the PyTorch profiler to analyze the execution time of the model

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider or an on-premise Arm server.
