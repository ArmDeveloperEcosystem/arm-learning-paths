        question: >
            What is SVE vector register length?
        answers:
            - "128 bits"
            - "Any vector length from 128 to 2048 bits"
        correct_answer: 2                   
        explanation: >
            SVE and SVE2 do not define the size of the vector registers, but limit the range, from a minimum of 128 bits up to a maximum of 2048 in 128-bit wide units.

        question: >
            Complete the sentence: the size of the predicate register is...
        answers:
            - "1/8th the size of SVE registers"
            - "the same size as the vector register"
            - "128 bits"
        correct_answer: 1                    
        explanation: >
            SVE is vector-length agnostic and a predicate-centric architecture with vector registers and predicate registers. Predicate registers are 1/8th the size of SVE registers (1 bit/byte).

        question: >
            Is SVE supported on all Arm v8-A and Arm v9-A processors?
        answers:
            - "Yes"
            - "No"
        correct_answer: 2                
        explanation: >
            Not all Arm v8-A processors support SVE instructions. However, they can still run SVE applications using the Arm Instruction Emulator. Armv9-A builds on SVE with the SVE2 extension.
