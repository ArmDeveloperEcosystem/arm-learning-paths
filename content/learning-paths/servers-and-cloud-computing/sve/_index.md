title: Port Code to Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE)

minutes_to_complete: 30   

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers using SIMD instructions for High-Performance Computing, Machine Learning, Digital Signal Processing, Audio and Video Codec applications.

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand the differences between SVE and NEON for vectorization
    - Compile code for SVE-capable Arm processors
    - Run SVE instructions on any Armv8-A processor

prerequisites:
    - General knowledge about SIMD processing, vectorization or Arm NEON.
    - An Arm computer running Linux. Cloud instances can be used, refer to the list of [Arm cloud service providers](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/).
