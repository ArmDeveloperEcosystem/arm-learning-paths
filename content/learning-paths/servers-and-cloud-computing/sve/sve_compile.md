## Compiling for SVE with GNU

Shown below are example commands to compile an application with support for SVE instructions using the GNU Toolchain:

### C 

For GCC, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -march=armv8-a+sve myapp.c -o myapp_c.out
```

### Fortran

For Fortran, use the following command:

```bash
gfortran -march=armv8-a+sve myapp.f90 -o myapp_f90.out
```

### Autovectorization

With GCC autovectorization is enabled with the `-03` option. To disable autovectorization, use `-fno-tree-vectorize` compiler option.

Compare the disassembly of a simple program shown below with and without the use of autovectorization:

{{< godbolt width="100%" height="400px" mode="diff" lopt="-O3 -march=armv8-a -fno-tree-vectorize" ropt="-O3 -march=armv8-a+sve" src="int fun(double * restrict a, double * restrict b, int size)\n{\n  for (int i=0; i < size; ++i)\n  {\n    b[i] += a[i];\n  }\n}" >}}

Note the use of double-word register _d0_, _d1_ instead of SVE registers _z0.d_ and _z1_ when you disable vectorization.

### Compiler insights

With GCC, the use of compiler option `-fopt-info-vec` returns which loops were vectorized. To return which loop failed to vectorize, use the `-fopt-info-vec-missed` compiler option.

{{< godbolt width="100%" height="400px" mode="output" opt="-O3 -march=armv8-a+sve -fopt-info-vec" src="int fun(double * restrict a, double * restrict b, int size)\n{\n  for (int i=0; i < size; ++i)\n  {\n    b[i] += a[i];\n  }\n}" >}}

In this example, the compiler reports the vectorization of loop line 3.

### Use Arm Performance Libraries

The Arm Performance Libraries include generic and target-specific SVE optimizations of common math operations used in HPC. To link your application with these libraries and GCC, use the predefined environment variables `ARMPL_INCLUDES` and `ARMPL_LIBRARIES`. The environment variables are set by the Arm Performance Libraries module files.

```bash
gcc -O3 -march=armv8-a+sve -I $ARMPL_INCLUDES dgemm.c -o dgemm.out -L $ARMPL_LIBRARIES -larmpl
```

## Compiling for SVE with Arm Compiler for Linux

Shown below are example commands to compile an application with support for SVE instructions using Arm Compiler for Linux:

### Arm C/C++ Compiler

```bash
armclang -march=armv8-a+sve myapp.c -o myapp_c.out
```

### Arm Fortran Compiler

```bash
armflang -march=armv8-a+sve myapp.f90 -o myapp_f90.out
```

### Compiling for a specific SVE target with Arm Compiler for Linux

If you are compiling for a SVE-capable target, you can use the `-march=native` compiler option. For specific CPUs with SVE support, use the `-mcpu` option:

CPU       | Flag    
----------|---------
Neoverse-N1 | `-mcpu=neoverse-n1` 
Neoverse-V1 | `-mcpu=neoverse-v1`

### Autovectorization

With Arm Compiler for Linux autovectorization is enabled with the `-02` option and above. To disable autovectorization, use `-fno-vectorize`.

### Compiler insights

With Arm Compiler for Linux, the option `-Rpass=vector` and `-Rpass=sve-loop-vectorize` return which loops were vectorized. To return the loops that failed to vectorize, use `-Rpass-missed=vector`.

### Use Arm Performance Libraries

To use Arm Performance Libraries with Arm Compiler for Linux use the `-armpl=sve` option. This ensures the SVE version of the library is used. Example command shown here:

```bash
armclang -O3 -march=armv8-a+sve -armpl=sve dgemm.c -o dgemm.out
```
