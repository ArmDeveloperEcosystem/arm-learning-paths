title: "ONNX in Action: Building, Optimizing, and Deploying Models on Arm64 and Mobile"

minutes_to_complete: 240

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who are interested in creating, optimizing, and deploying machine learning models with ONNX. It is especially useful for those targeting Arm64-based devices (such as Raspberry Pi, mobile SoCs, or Android smartphones) and looking to run efficient inference at the edge.

learning_objectives:
  - Describe what ONNX is, and what it can offer in the ML ecosystem.
  - Build and export a simple neural network model in Python to ONNX format.
  - Perform inference and training using ONNX Runtime.
  - Apply optimization techniques to improve performance.
  - Deploy an optimized ONNX model inside an Android app.

prerequisites:
  - A development machine with Python 3.10+ installed.
  - Basic familiarity with PyTorch or TensorFlow.
  - An Arm64 device (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Android smartphone).
  - "[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed for deployment testing."
