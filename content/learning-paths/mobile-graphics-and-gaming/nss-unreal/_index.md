minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers experimenting with neural graphics using Unreal Engine® and ML Extensions for Vulkan®.


learning_objectives:
    - Understand how Arm enables neural graphics for game development
    - Configure ML extensions for Vulkan emulation
    - Enable Neural Super Sampling (NSS) in Unreal Engine
    - Run and visualize real-time upscaling with NSS


prerequisites:
    - Windows 11
    - Unreal Engine 5.5 (Templates and Feature Pack enabled)
    - Visual Studio 2022 (with Desktop Development with C++ and .NET desktop build tools)
