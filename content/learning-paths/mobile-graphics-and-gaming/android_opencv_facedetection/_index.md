title: Detect faces with OpenCV on Android Devices

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who are interested in creating Computer Vision applications with OpenCV on Android devices. 

learning_objectives:
   - Describe how you can use OpenCV for face detection.   
   - Use OpenCV to retrieve camera frames.
   - Use Haar cascade classifier for face detection.

prerequisites:
   - A development machine with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed. 
   - An Android smartphone.
   - Familiarity with OpenCV, review [Create Computer Vision Applications with OpenCV on Android Devices](/learning-paths/mobile-graphics-and-gaming/android_opencv_camera/) before starting.
