title: Get started with neural graphics using ML Extensions for VulkanÂ®

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for engine developers interested in learning about neural graphics using ML Extensions for Vulkan.

learning_objectives:
    - Explain the purpose of neural graphics and the role of ML Extensions for Vulkan
    - Set up the ML Emulation Layers for Vulkan to enable the extensions
    - Run a sample Vulkan application that uses the extensions
    - Debug the flow using RenderDoc

prerequisites:
    - Windows 11 development machine
    - Visual Studio 2022
    - Visual Studio workload - Desktop development with C++
    - Visual Studio workload - .NET desktop build tools
