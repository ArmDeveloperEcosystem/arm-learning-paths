title: Profile the Performance of AI and ML Mobile Applications on Arm

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to learn how to profile the performance of Machine Learning (ML) models running on Arm devices.

learning_objectives: 
    - Profile the execution times of ML models on Arm devices.
    - Profile ML application performance on Arm devices.
    - Describe how profiling can help optimize the performance of Machine Learning applications.

prerequisites:
    - An Arm-powered Android smartphone, and a USB cable to connect to it.
    - For profiling the ML inference, [Arm NN ExecuteNetwork](https://github.com/ARM-software/armnn/releases) or [ExecuTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch).
    - For profiling the application, [Arm Performance Studio with Streamline](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Performance%20Studio).
    - Android Studio Profiler.
