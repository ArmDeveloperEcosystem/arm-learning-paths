## Summary
This learning path vividly explains how an SME2-optimized KleidiAI microkernel performs quantization and packing of the RHS and LHS, and how it leverages the powerful SME2 MOPA instructions to enhance matrix multiplication performance. We hope this learning path helps developers learn how to integrate the KleidiAI microkernel into their ML/AI frameworks or applications, or to design their own SME2-optimized kernels, thus fully utilizing the potential of SME2.
