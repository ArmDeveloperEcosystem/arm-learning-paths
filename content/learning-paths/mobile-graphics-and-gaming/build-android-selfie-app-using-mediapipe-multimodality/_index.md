minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for mobile application developers interested in learning how to build an Android selfie application with Modern MediaPipe Multimodal AI, Kotlin flows, and CameraX, using the Modern Android Development (MAD) architecture design.

learning_objectives:
    - Architect a modern hands-free selfie Android app with MediaPipe.
    - Leverage lifecycle-aware components within the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture.
    - Combine MediaPipe's face landmark detection and gesture recognition for integration in a multimodel selfie solution.
    - Use JetPack CameraX to access camera features.
    - Use Kotlin Flow APIs to handle multiple asynchronous data streams.

prerequisites:
    - A development machine with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed.
    - A recent Arm-powered Android phone with a front-facing camera and a USB data cable.
    - Familiarity with Android development concepts.
    - Basic knowledge of Modern Android Architecture. See [Modern Android App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-architecture).
    - Basic knowledge of Kotlin programming language, including [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) and [Kotlin Flows](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html).
