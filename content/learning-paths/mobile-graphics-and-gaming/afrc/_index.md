title: Learn about Arm Fixed Rate Compression (AFRC)

minutes_to_complete: 25

who_is_this_for: Software developers of Android applications and mobile games who are interested in learning how to enable Arm Fixed Rate Compression (AFRC) to improve performance.

learning_objectives: 
    - Query for fixed-rate compression support.
    - Specify what compression to use.
    - Verify that compression is applied.

prerequisites:
    - An appropriate Android device (e.g., Google Pixel 8) supporting the required Vulkan extensions.
    - Knowledge of the Vulkan API.
    - A Vulkan application that creates and uses images. This Learning Path shows how to use an API Sample in the [Khronos Vulkan Samples repository](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/blob/main/scripts/README.adoc#generate-api-sample) as an example.
