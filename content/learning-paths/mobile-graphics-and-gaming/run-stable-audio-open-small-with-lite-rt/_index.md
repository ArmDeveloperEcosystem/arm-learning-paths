title: Generate audio with Stable Audio Open Small on LiteRT

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers looking to deploy the Stable Audio Open Small text-to-audio model using LiteRT on an Android device.

learning_objectives:
    - Download and test the Stable Audio Open Small model. 
    - Convert the Stable Audio Open Small model to the LiteRT (.tflite) format.
    - Compile the application for an Arm CPU.
    - Create a simple application that generates audio. 
    - Run the application on an Android smartphone and generate an audio snippet.

prerequisites:
    - A Linux-based x86 or macOS development machine with at least 8 GB of RAM (tested on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS with x86_64).
    - A [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) account.
    - An Android phone and a cable to connect it to your development machine.
