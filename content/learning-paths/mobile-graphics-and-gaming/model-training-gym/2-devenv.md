In this section, you will install a few dependencies into your Ubuntu environment. You'll need a working Python 3.10+ environment with some ML and system dependencies. Make sure Python is installed by verifying the version is printed:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Next, install a few additional packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv python-is-python3 gcc make python3-dev -y
```

## Set up the examples repository

The example notebooks are open-sourced in a GitHub repository. Start by cloning it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arm/neural-graphics-model-gym-examples.git
cd neural-graphics-model-gym-examples
```

From inside the `neural-graphics-model-gym-examples/` folder, run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- create a Python virtual environment called `nb-env`
- install the `ng-model-gym` package and required dependencies
- download the datasets and weights needed to run the notebooks

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source nb-env/bin/activate
```

Run the following in a python shell to confirm that the script was successful:

```python
import torch
import ng_model_gym

print("Torch version:", torch.__version__)
print("Model Gym version:", ng_model_gym.__version__)
```

Youâ€™re now ready to start walking through the training and evaluation steps.
