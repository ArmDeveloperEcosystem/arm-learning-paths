title: Fine-tuning neural graphics models with Model Gym
   
minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for developers exploring neural graphics and interested in training and deploying upscaling models like Neural Super Sampling (NSS) using PyTorch and Arm’s hardware-aware backend.

learning_objectives:
    - Understand the principles of neural graphics and how it’s applied to game performance
    - Learn how to fine-tune and evaluate a neural network for Neural Super Sampling (NSS)
    - Use the Model Gym Python API and CLI to configure and train neural graphics models
    - Visualize and inspect .vgf models using the Model Explorer tool

prerequisites:
    - Basic understanding of PyTorch and machine learning concepts
    - A development machine running Ubuntu 22.04, with a CUDA-capable NVIDIA® GPU
    - CUDA Toolkit version 11.8 or later
