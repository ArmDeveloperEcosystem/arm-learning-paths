## Switch to developer mode

In the previous section, you built the Voice Assistant application. Now, you'll install it on your Android phone. The easiest way is to enable developer mode and use a USB cable to upload the application.

By default, Android devices ship with developer mode disabled. To enable it, follow [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).

## Install the Voice Assistant

Once developer mode is enabled, connect your phone to your computer with USB. It should appear as a running device in the top toolbar. Select the device and click **Run** (a small green triangle, as shown below). This transfers the app to your phone and launches it.


In the graphic below, a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 phone is connected to the USB cable:
