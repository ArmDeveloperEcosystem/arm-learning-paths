minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who want to see a multi-model pipeline of a Voice Assistant application and accelerate the performance on Android devices using KleidiAI and SME2.

learning_objectives:
    - Compile and run a Voice Assistant Android application.
    - Optimize performance using KleidiAI and SME2.

prerequisites:
    - An Android phone that supports the i8mm Arm architecture feature (8-bit integer matrix multiplication). This Learning Path was tested on a Google Pixel 8 Pro.
