title: Accelerate multimodal Voice Assistant performance with KleidiAI and SME2

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who want to implement a multimodal pipeline for a Voice Assistant application and accelerate the performance on Android devices using KleidiAI and SME2.

learning_objectives:
    - Learn about the multimodal Voice Assistant pipeline and different components used.
    - Learn about the functionality of ML components used and how these can be built and benchmarked on various platforms.
    - Compile and run a multimodal Voice Assistant example based on Android OS.
    - Optimize performance of multimodal Voice Assistant using KleidiAI and SME2.

prerequisites:
    - An Android phone that supports the i8mm Arm architecture feature (8-bit integer matrix multiplication).
    - An Android phone with support for SME (Scalable Matrix Extension) instructions, required for SME performance checking
    - This Learning Path was tested on a Vivo X300 Pro.
    - A development machine with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed.
