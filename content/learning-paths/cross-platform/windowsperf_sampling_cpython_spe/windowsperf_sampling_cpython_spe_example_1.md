## Sample CPython using SPE

To test the profiling capabilities, you can stress CPython by using the [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) binary that you built from source in debug mode to compute a large integer number called a [Googolplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex). 

To do this, follow these steps:

* Pin the `python_d.exe` interactive console to an arbitrary CPU core, and calculate `10^10^100`.
* Run counting and sampling to obtain event information.

### Pin CPython to CPU core 1

Start by using the Windows `start` command to execute and pin `python_d.exe` process to CPU core 1. 

Run the command below at a Windows Command Prompt to execute the computation intensive calculation:

```command
start /affinity 2 cpython\PCbuild\arm64\python_d.exe -c 10**10**100
```

{{% notice Note %}}
The [start](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/start) command  line `/affinity <hexaffinity>` applies the specified processor affinity mask (expressed as a hexadecimal number). In this example, decimal `2` is `0x02` or `0b0010`. This value denotes core number `1` as `1` is a second bit in the mask, where the mask is indexed from `0`.

You can use the Windows Task Manager to confirm that `python_d.exe` is running on CPU core 1.

### WindowsPerf and SPE filters

You can specify SPE filters using the `-e` command line option with `arm_spe_0//`. 

The `arm_spe_0/*/` notation is available for the `sample` and `record` commands, where `*` represents a comma-separated list of supported filters. 

Currently, filters such as `store_filter=`, `load_filter=`, and `branch_filter=`, or their short equivalents like `st=`, `ld=`, and `b=`, use `0` or `1` to disable or enable a given filter. 

Here are some filter examples:

```output
arm_spe_0/branch_filter=1/
arm_spe_0/load_filter=1,branch_filter=0/
arm_spe_0/ld=1,branch_filter=0/
arm_spe_0/st=0,ld=0,b=1/
```

#### Filtering sample records

The SPE register, `PMSFCR_EL1.FT`, enables filtering by operation type. 

When enabled, `PMSFCR_EL1.{ST, LD, B}` defines the collected types:

* `ST` enables collection of store-sampled operations, including all atomic operations.
* `LD` enables collection of load-sampled operations, including atomic operations that return a value to a register.
* `B` enables collection of branch-sampled operations, including direct and indirect branches and exception returns.

### Sample CPython using SPE 

The command below samples the running `python_d.exe` process. 

The SPE filter `ld=1` enables collection of load sampled operations, including atomic operations that return a value to a register.

```command
wperf sample -e arm_spe_0/ld=1/ --pe_file cpython\PCbuild\arm64\python_d.exe --image_name python_d.exe -c 1
```

{{% notice  Note%}}
You can use the same sampling `--annotate` and `--disassemble` command line interface of WindowsPerf with the SPE extension. This is shown in the example output below.

It takes a few seconds for the samples to arrive from the Kernel driver. You can press Ctrl+C to stop sampling. 

You will see an output similar to:

```output
base address of 'python_d.exe': 0x7ff765fe1288, runtime delta: 0x7ff625fe0000
sampling ....eee....eCtrl-C received, quit counting... done!

```

You can close the command-line window running `python_d.exe` when you have finished sampling. 

Sampling also automatically ends when the sampled process exits.

#### SPE sampling output

In the output above, you see that the majority of overhead generated by `python_d.exe` resides in the `python312_d.dll` DLL, in the `x_mul` symbol.

SPE sampling output also contains PMU events for the SPE-registered events. 

Here are some helpful definitions:

  * `sample_pop` - Counts statistical profiling sample population, which is the count of all operations that can be sampled but might or might not be chosen for sampling.
  * `sample_feed` - Counts statistical profiling samples taken.
  * `sample_filtrate` - Counts statistical profiling samples taken which are not removed by filtering.
  * `sample_collision` - Counts statistical profiling samples that have collided with a previous sample and therefore not taken.

During sampling the `....eee....e` output is a progressing printout where:
  * Each `.` character represents an SPE sample payload received from the WindowsPerf Kernel driver.
  * Each `e` character represents an unsuccessful attempt - an empty SPE fill buffer - to fetch the whole sample payload.

{{% notice  Note%}}
You can also generate `wperf sample` output in JSON format. Use the `--json` command-line option to enable the JSON output.
Use the `-v` command-line option `verbose` to add more information about sampling.

#### Example output with annotate enabled

The `--annotate` command-line option enables translating addresses taken from samples in sample/record mode into source code line numbers.

For example:

```console
wperf sample -e arm_spe_0/ld=1/ --annotate --pe_file cpython\PCbuild\arm64\python_d.exe --image_name python_d.exe -c 1
```

The output is similar to:

```output
base address of 'python_d.exe': 0x7ff765fe1288, runtime delta: 0x7ff625fe0000
sampling ....ee.Ctrl-C received, quit counting...e done!

```

The above SPE sampling pass records that the function `x_mul:python312_d.dll`
in source file `C:\path\to\cpython\Objects\longobject.c`, line `3590` is a hot spot for the `load_filter`.

#### Example output with disassemble enabled

The `--disassemble` command-line option enables disassembly output, and also implies `--annotate`.

For example:

```console
wperf sample -e arm_spe_0/ld=1/ --disassemble --pe_file cpython\PCbuild\arm64\python_d.exe --image_name python_d.exe -c 1
```

The output is similar to:

```output

The output above shows that the function `x_mul:python312_d.dll` is a hot spot which comes from the following source code lines:
  - File `C:\path\to\cpython\Objects\longobject.c`, line `3591`, instruction `ldr   x9, [sp, #0x20]` at address `0x4043b4` as potential hot-spot.
  - File `C:\path\to\cpython\Objects\longobject.c`, line `3589`, instruction `ldr   x8, [sp, #0x58]` at address `0x404360` as potential hot-spot.

Another potential hot spot is in the function `v_isub:python312_d.dll` in the source file `C:\path\to\cpython\Objects\longobject.c`, line `1603`, instruction `ldr   w8, [sp, #0x10]` at address `0x402a60`.
