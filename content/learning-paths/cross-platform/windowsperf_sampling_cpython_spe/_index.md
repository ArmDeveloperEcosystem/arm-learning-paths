minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers keen to understand sampling with the Arm Statistical Profiling Extension (SPE).

learning_objectives:
    - Use WindowsPerf with a native Windows on Arm workload.
    - Understand the basics of sampling with Arm SPE.
    - Explore the WindowsPerf command line.
    - Build CPython from sources for Windows on Arm (ARM64).

prerequisites:
    - Windows on Arm desktop or development machine with [WindowsPerf](/install-guides/wperf), [Visual Studio](/install-guides/vs-woa/), and [Git](/install-guides/git-woa/) installed.
    - The Windows on Arm system must have an Arm CPU with SPE support.
