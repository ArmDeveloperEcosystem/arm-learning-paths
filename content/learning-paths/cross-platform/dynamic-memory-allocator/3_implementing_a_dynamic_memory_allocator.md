title: Implement a dynamic memory allocator
weight: 4

### FIXED, DO NOT MODIFY
layout: learningpathall

The source code of the `simple_malloc` and `simple_free` memory allocation functions are below. 
Everything required to build and run example allocations are also provided. 

You will need a Linux machine to try the code and see how the allocation works. 

## Project structure

The files used are: 
* `CMakeLists.txt` - Tells `cmake` how to configure and build the project
* `heap.c` - The dynamic memory allocator implementation
* `heap.h` - Function declarations including your new `simple_malloc` and
	`simple_free` functions
* `main.c` - A test program that makes use of `simple_malloc` and `simple_free`

Building it will produce a single binary `demo` that you can run and see the results.

## Source code

The files are listed below. 

Use a text editor to copy and paste the contents of each file on a Linux machine.

Contents of `CMakeLists.txt`:

``` {file_name="CMakeLists.txt"}
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)

project(MemoryAllocatorDemo C)

add_executable(demo main.c heap.c)
```

Contents of `heap.h`:

```C {file_name="heap.h"}
#include <stddef.h>

// Call once at the start of main() to initialise the empty heap.
// This is the equivalent of what your C library is doing before main() for the
// system heap.
void simple_heap_init();

void *simple_malloc(size_t size);

void simple_free(void *ptr);
```

## Information about heap.c

Please refer to the comments in the source code here for detailed explanations
of each function. You can identify a few key elements before studying the code.

First is `storage`, this is the backing storage which is a global char array.
This is where the ranges, represented by `Header`, are stored.

Each `Header` is written to the start of the allocated range. This means that
`simple_malloc` returns a pointer that points just beyond this location. `simple_free`, on the
other hand, deducts the size of the `Header` from the pointer parameter to find the
range information.

When the heap is initialized with `simple_heap_init`, a single range is setup
that covers the whole heap and marks it as unallocated.

To find a free range, `find_free_space` walks the heap using these `Header`
values until it finds a large enough free range, or gets beyond the end of the
heap.

For the first allocation the job is straightforward; there's one range and it's
all free. Split that into 2 ranges, using the first for the allocation.

On subsequent allocations there will be more header values to read, but the
logic is the same.

{{% notice Addresses in Logging%}}
The logging enabled by `log_events` may not have deterministic output
on systems where features like Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) are
enabled. Generally run to run, the output addresses may change. Focus on the
relative values of pointers in relation to where the heap starts and ends.

Contents of `main.c`:

```C { file_name="main.c"}
#include "heap.h"

int main() {
  simple_heap_init();

  char *ptr = simple_malloc(100);
  char *ptr2 = simple_malloc(240);
  char *ptr3 = simple_malloc(256);
  char *ptr4 = simple_malloc(333);
  simple_free(ptr2);
  simple_free(ptr3);
  char *ptr5 = simple_malloc(300);

  return 0;
}
```

The main code does allocation and de-allocation of memory. This tests the heap
code but also highlights an interesting problem that you'll see more about later.

## Build the source code

Install the required tools using the command: 

```bash
sudo apt install -y cmake ninja-build
```

Next, configure using CMake. You can use a Debug build for the extra safety the
asserts bring.

```bash
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G Ninja
```

## Build and run a test

Build the executable with `ninja`:

```bash
ninja
```

You now have a `demo` executable in the same folder. 

Run `demo` to see the allocator in action:

```bash
./demo
```

## Review the program output

The output addresses will vary depending on where the backing memory gets allocated
by your system but this is the general form you should expect:

```text
Simple heap init:
Storage [0x559871a24040 -> 0x559871a25040) (4096 bytes)
[0x559871a24040] Set header to 0x0000000000001000 (free, size = 4096 bytes)
  [0x559871a24040 -> 0x559871a25040) : 0x0000000000001000 (free, size = 4096 bytes)
```

The addresses on the left usually refer to an action. In this case we've set
a `Header` value at `0x559871a24040`.

The list in the last few lines is the set of ranges you would see if you walked the
heap, which is exactly what the allocator is seeing. The use of `[` followed by `)`
means that the start address is included in the range, but the end address is
not. This is the initial heap state where everything is free.

Next there is a call `simple_malloc(100)` which produces:

```text
Trying to allocate 100 bytes
[0x55e68c41f040] Set header to 0x800000000000006c (allocated, size = 108 bytes)
[0x55e68c41f0ac] Set header to 0x0000000000000f94 (free, size = 3988 bytes)
[0x55e68c41f048] Memory was allocated, size 100 bytes
  [0x55e68c41f040 -> 0x55e68c41f0ac) : 0x800000000000006c (allocated, size = 108 bytes)
  [0x55e68c41f0ac -> 0x55e68c420040) : 0x0000000000000f94 (free, size = 3988 bytes)
```

You can see that a request was made for 100 bytes and the allocator decided to split
the 1 range into 2. It updated both the new ranges' header information.

Note that although it says `[0x559871a24048] Memory was allocated`, you do not
see a range starting from this address. This is because this address is the one
returned to the user. Take the size of `Header` from this address and you get the
start of the range which is `0x559871a24040` as shown in the first range in the
list.

You'll also notice that the allocated range is 8 bytes bigger than the user
asked for. This is because it includes that `Header` at the start of it.

If you skip ahead to after the `free` calls have been made, you will see:

```text
[0x55e68c41f1ac] Freeing allocation
[0x55e68c41f1a4] Set header to 0x0000000000000108 (free, size = 264 bytes)
[0x55e68c41f1ac] Memory was freed
  [0x55e68c41f040 -> 0x55e68c41f0ac) : 0x800000000000006c (allocated, size = 108 bytes)
  [0x55e68c41f0ac -> 0x55e68c41f1a4) : 0x00000000000000f8 (free, size = 248 bytes)
  [0x55e68c41f1a4 -> 0x55e68c41f2ac) : 0x0000000000000108 (free, size = 264 bytes)
  [0x55e68c41f2ac -> 0x55e68c41f401) : 0x8000000000000155 (allocated, size = 341 bytes)
  [0x55e68c41f401 -> 0x55e68c420040) : 0x0000000000000c3f (free, size = 3135 bytes)
```

Which shows you that the second and third allocations were freed, and there is
still a large range of free memory on the end.

Try to understand what the final allocation result is. Is the choice of location
expected or would you have expected it to fit elsewhere in the heap?
