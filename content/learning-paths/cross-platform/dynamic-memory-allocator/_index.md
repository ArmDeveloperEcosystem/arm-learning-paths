title: Write a Dynamic Memory Allocator

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers learning about dynamic memory allocation for the first time, and who may have used malloc and free in C programming. It also provides a starting point to explore more advanced memory allocation topics.

layout: learningpathall
learning_objectives:
- Explain how dynamic memory allocation and the C heap works
- Write a simple dynamic memory allocator
- Explain some of the risks of heap allocation in general

prerequisites:
- Familiarity with C programming, with a good understanding of pointers.
- A Linux machine to run the example code.
