title: "Code kata: perfect your SVE and SME skills with SIMD Loops"

minutes_to_complete: 30

draft: true
cascade:
    draft: true

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers who want to learn how to use the full range of features available in SVE, SVE2 and SME2 to improve software performance on Arm processors.

learning_objectives:
     - Improve SIMD code performance using Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) and Scalable Matrix Extension (SME).

prerequisites:
    - An AArch64 computer running Linux or macOS. You can use cloud instances, refer to [Get started with Arm-based cloud instances](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) for a list of cloud service providers. 
    - Some familiarity with SIMD programming and NEON intrinsics.
