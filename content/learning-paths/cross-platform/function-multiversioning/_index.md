title: Learn about function multiversioning

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for developers interested in optimizing their C/C++ applications across Arm64 targets.

learning_objectives:
    - Use hardware features to tune your applications at function level.
    - Create multiple versions of C/C++ functions for the targets that you intend to run applications on.
    - Assist the compiler in generating optimal code for the targets, or provide your own optimized versions at source level.
    - Automatically select the most appropriate function version at runtime.
    - Reuse your optimized application binaries across various targets.

prerequisites:
    - Basic knowledge of GNU function attributes. 
    - Familiarity with indirect functions (ifuncs).
    - Basic knowledge of loop vectorization.
    - Familiarity with Arm assembly.
    - A LLVM 19 compiler with runtime library support or GCC 14.
