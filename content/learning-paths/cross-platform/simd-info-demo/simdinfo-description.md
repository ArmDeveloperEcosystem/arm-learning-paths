### Comprehensive SIMD.info Capabilities
**[SIMD.info](https://simd.info/)** offers a variety of powerful tools to help developers work more efficiently with SIMD code across different architectures. With a database of over 10,000 intrinsics, it provides detailed information to support effective SIMD development.

For each intrinsic, SIMD.info provides comprehensive details, including:

1. **Purpose**: A brief description of what the intrinsic does and its primary use case.
2. **Result**: Explanation of the output or result of the intrinsic.
3. **Example**: A code snippet demonstrating how to use the intrinsic.
4. **Prototypes**: Function prototypes for different programming languages (currently C/C++).
5. **Assembly Instruction**: The corresponding assembly instruction used by the intrinsic.
6. **Notes**: Any additional notes or caveats about the intrinsic.
7. **Architecture**: List of architectures that support the intrinsic
8. **Link(s) to Official Documentation**

This detailed information ensures you have all the necessary resources to effectively use and port SIMD instructions across different platforms. Each feature is designed to simplify navigation, improve the search for equivalent instructions, and foster a collaborative environment for knowledge-sharing.

- **Tree-based navigation:** **SIMD.info** uses a clear, hierarchical layout to organize instructions. It categorizes instructions into broad groups like **Arithmetic**, which are further divided into specific subcategories such as **Vector Add** and **Vector Subtract**. This organized structure makes it straightforward to browse through SIMD instruction sets across various platforms, allowing you to efficiently find and access the exact instructions you need.
An example of how the tree structure looks like:


    - **Arithmetic** 
    - **Arithmetic (Complex Numbers)** 
    - **Boolean Logic & Bit Manipulation** 
        - **Boolean AND** 
        - **Boolean AND NOT** 
            - **Boolean AND NOT 128-bit vector** 
            - **Boolean AND NOT 16-bit signed integers** 
            - **Boolean AND NOT 16-bit unsigned integers** 
            - **Boolean AND NOT 256-bit vector**
            - **Boolean AND NOT 32-bit floats** 
            - **Boolean AND NOT 32-bit signed integers** 
                - AVX512: mm512_andnot_epi32 
                - NEON: vbic_s32
                - NEON: vbicq_s32 
                - VSX: vec_andc 
        - **Bit Clear** 
        - **XOR**

- **Advanced search functionality:** With its robust search engine, **SIMD.info** allows you to either search for a specific intrinsic (e.g. `vaddq_f64`) or enter more general terms (e.g. *How to add 2 vectors*), and it will return a list of the corresponding intrinsics. You can also filter results based on the specific engine you're working with, such as **NEON**, **SSE4.2**, **AVX**, **AVX512**, **VSX**. This functionality streamlines the process of finding the right commands tailored to your needs.

- **Comparison tools:** This feature lets you directly compare SIMD instructions from different (or the same) platforms side by side, offering a clear view of the similarities and differences. It’s a very helpful tool for porting code across architectures, as it ensures accuracy and efficiency.

- **Discussion forum (like StackOverflow):** The integrated discussion forum, powered by **[discuss](https://disqus.com/)** allows users to ask questions, share insights, and troubleshoot problems together. This community-driven space ensures that you’re never stuck on a complex issue without support, fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing among SIMD developers. Imagine something like **StackOverflow** but specific to SIMD intrinsics.

You can now learn how to use these features in the context of an actual example.
