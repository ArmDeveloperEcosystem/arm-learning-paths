title: Introduction to SIMD.info

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for software developers who are interested in porting SIMD code across Arm platforms.

learning_objectives: 
    - Describe how to use SIMD.infoâ€™s tools and features, such as navigation, search, and comparison, to simplify the process of finding equivalent SIMD intrinsics between architectures to improve code portability.

prerequisites:
    - A basic understanding of SIMD.
    - Access to an Arm platform with a SIMD-supported engine, installed with recent versions of a C compiler such as Clang or GCC.
