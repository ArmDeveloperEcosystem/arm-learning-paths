### The Challenge of SIMD Code Portability
One of the biggest challenges developers face when working with SIMD code is making it portable across different platforms. SIMD instructions are designed to increase performance by executing the same operation on multiple data elements in parallel. However, each architecture has its own set of SIMD instructions, making it difficult to write code that works on all of them without major changes to the code and/or algorithm.

To port software written using Intel intrinsics, like SSE/AVX/AVX512, to Arm Neon, you have pay attention to data handling with the different instruction sets.

Having to port the code between architectures can increase development time and introduce the risk of errors during the porting process. Currently, developers rely on ISA documentation and manually search across various vendor platforms like [Arm Developer](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets/intrinsics/) and [Intel Intrinsics Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html) to find equivalent instructions.

[SIMD.info](https://simd.info) aims to solve this by helping you find equivalent instructions and providing a more streamlined way to adapt your code for different architectures.
