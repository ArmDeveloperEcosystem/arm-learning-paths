### The Challenge of SIMD Code Portability
SIMD instructions are designed to improve performance by executing the same operation on multiple data elements in parallel. One of the biggest challenges developers face when working with SIMD code is making it portable across different platforms.  

Each architecture has its own set of SIMD instructions, which makes it difficult to port code without major changes to either the code itself, or the algorithm, or both.

For example, to port software written using Intel intrinsics, such as SSE/AVX/AVX512, to Arm Neon, you must address issues with data handling with the different instruction sets.

Porting the code between architectures can increase development time and introduce the risk of errors. Currently, developers rely on ISA documentation and must manually search across various vendor platforms such as [Arm Developer](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets/intrinsics/) and [Intel Intrinsics Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html) to find equivalent instructions.

[SIMD.info](https://simd.info) aims to address this challenge by enabling developers to find equivalent instructions and providing a streamlined way to adapt code for different architectures.
