title: Understand floating-point behavior across x86 and Arm architectures

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is a topic for developers who are porting applications from x86 to Arm and want to understand floating-point behavior across these architectures. Both architectures provide reliable and consistent floating-point computation following the IEEE 754 standard.

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand that Arm and x86 produce identical results for all well-defined floating-point operations.
    - Recognize that differences only occur in special undefined cases permitted by IEEE 754.
    - Learn to recognize floating-point differences and make your code portable across architectures.

prerequisites:
    - Access to an x86 and an Arm Linux machine.
    - Familiarity with floating-point numbers.
