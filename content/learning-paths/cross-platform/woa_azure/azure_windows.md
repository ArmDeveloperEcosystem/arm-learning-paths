## Create Windows on Arm virtual machine

[Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#home) is a cloud computing platform. You can log into Azure using either your personal subsciption or your organization's subscription.

Start by locating [Virtual Machines](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines) from the list of `Azure Services`, then click `Create` > `Azure virtual machine`.

You will be presented with the `Create a virtual machine` dialog. On this dialog, first select your `Subscription` and `Resource group`. Then, enter a `Virtual Machine name` and select the `Region` in which you want to create your Windows on Arm Virtual machine.  

Next, for `VM Architecture` select `Arm64`.

Then click on `See all images` (under `Image`) and filter `Image Type` for `Arm64` as show in the image below:

You will be presented with all the VM images that are available for Arm. Select `Windows 11 Professional - Arm64` from the drop-down menu under `Microsoft Windows 11` as shown below.

You will then be returned to the `Create a virtual machine` dialog screen with your selections. Change the `Security type` setting to `Standard`. 

Under the `Administrator account` section enter a `Username` and `Password` in the fields provided. You will use these credentials to access your Windows virtual machine.

In the `Inbound port rules` section of the dialog, select `Allow selected ports` and choose `RDP (3389)` from the drop-down menu.

Finally, under the `Licensing` section you will need to confirm that you have an eligible Windows 10/11 license with multi-tenant hosting rights. To learn more about the licensing before you select this checkbox read this [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/windows-desktop-multitenant-hosting-deployment).

Leaving other settings as default, click `Review + create`.

All your selections will be validated and you can click `Create` to launch your Windows on Arm virtual machine.

Once the deployment of your virtual machine is complete, click on `Go to Resource`. From here you will be able to view the `Public IP address` of your virtual machine which you will use in the next step to connect to your VM instance. 

## Connect to your Windows on Arm VM

On your local host PC, launch the `Remote Desktop Connection` application.

Enter the `Public IP Address` of the Windows VM as the `Computer` to be connected to.

Next, username (set earlier while creating the VM instance), and when prompted the password, and you will connect.

You can now interact with the VM in the same way as you would a local desktop.

If you have issues connecting to your instance, see this Microsoft article:
* [How to connect using Remote Desktop and sign on to an Azure virtual machine running Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-rdp)

## Explore your VM

Open `Control Panel` > `System`, and verify that `Device` > `System Type` identifies as an Arm-based processor.
