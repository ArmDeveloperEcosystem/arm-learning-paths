title: Deploy UltraEdge HPC-I for AI and mixed workloads on Arm
minutes_to_complete: 60 

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for business, R&D, and engineering teams seeking to optimize CPU and GPU infrastructure utilization while reducing total cost of ownership on edge and constrained environments. It's ideal for innovation and development teams building next-generation AI workloads using alternative runtime environments and packaging technologies.

learning_objectives:
  - Understand the layered architecture of UltraEdge core, boost, and prime
  - Build applications using the UltraEdge MicroStack
  - Deploy the MicroPacs on Linux-based compute systems and scale to cloud or data-center environments
  - Optimize performance for edge-cloud scenarios, enabling near real-time data flows


prerequisites:
  - Experience using Linux on embedded or SBC platforms
  - Understanding of container runtimes (containerd) and CNI networking
  - Basic knowledge of communication protocols (MQTT, HTTP, and others)
  - Familiarity with edge-cloud architectures and data-flow orchestration
