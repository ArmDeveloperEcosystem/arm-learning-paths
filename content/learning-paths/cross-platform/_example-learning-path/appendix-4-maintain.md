## How to review a Learning Path

Keeping Learning Paths and Install Guides up to date is an ongoing responsibility. The goal of content maintenance is to ensure that guides remain technically correct as tools, platforms, and dependencies constantly evolve.

When reviewing content, focus on identifying risk, drift, and breakage that could impact a user’s ability to successfully follow the guide today. Look for issues such as:

### Outdated dependencies or assumptions

* Old OS versions, runtimes, or toolchains
* Deprecated frameworks, libraries, or models
* Hardware assumptions that may no longer hold


### Ecosystem changes

* Referenced repositories that are archived or inactive
* Installation methods or CLIs that have changed
* External services or downloads that no longer exist or have moved

### Version drift and ambiguity

* Use of “latest” without version context
* Missing or unclear compatibility guidance
* Mismatches between stated prerequisites and actual steps

### Trust and usability signals

* Broken or redirected links
* UI instructions or screenshots that no longer match reality
* Formatting or rendering issues that undermine confidence
