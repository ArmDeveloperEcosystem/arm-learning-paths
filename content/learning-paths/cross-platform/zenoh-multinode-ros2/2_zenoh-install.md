## Setting Up Zenoh on Arm Devices

The following instructions have been verified on both Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 devices, but you can implement them on any Arm Linux device.

Before building Zenoh, make sure your system has the necessary development tools and runtime libraries.

### Install the Rust development environment

First, install the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) environment, since the core of Zenoh is developed using Rust to keep it safe and efficient.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl gcc
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
```

Near the end of the installation you will see the success message:

```output
Rust is installed now. Great!
```

Make sure to source the environment to add Rust to your shell environment:

```bash
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

You can learn more using the [Rust install guide](/install-guides/rust/) for Arm Linux.

### Install ROS 2

[Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org/) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. ROS provides everything from drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, as well as developer tools. It is completely open-source.

Follow the [ROS2 installation guide](/install-guides/ros2/) to install ROS 2 on your Arm platforms.

### Download and build the Zenoh source

Clone the Zenoh repository:

```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh.git
```

After cloning, use cargo to build the source:

```bash
cd zenoh
cargo build --release --all-targets -j $(nproc)
```

This process will take several minutes depending on your device. Once the installation is complete, you should see:

If you get a build error:
```output
error[E0599]: no function or associated item named `start` found for struct `StoragesPlugin` in the current scope
   --> plugins/zenoh-plugin-storage-manager/tests/operations.rs:91:55
```

Edit the file `./plugins/zenoh-plugin-storage-manager/tests/operations.rs` and comment the line shown below and add the second line to the file:

```rust
//use zenoh_plugin_trait::Plugin;
use crate::path::to::Plugin;
```

Run the build again:

```bash
cargo clean && cargo build
```

With Zenoh successfully compiled, you’re ready to explore how nodes communicate using the Zenoh runtime.
