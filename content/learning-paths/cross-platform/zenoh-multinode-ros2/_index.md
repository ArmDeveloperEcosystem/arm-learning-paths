who_is_this_for: This learning path is designed for robotics developers, industrial automation engineers, and IoT system architects building distributed, scalable, and low-latency applications. Whether you are using Robot Operating System (ROS), developing autonomous systems, or designing multi-node communication frameworks, this guide will show you how to leverage the Eclipse Zenoh protocol on Arm-based platforms â€” both in the cloud (AVH or EC2) and on physical devices like Raspberry Pi.

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand Zenoh's architecture and its integration of pub/sub, storage, querying, and computation models.
    - Build and run Zenoh examples on both Arm servers and Raspberry Pi.
    - Set up and deploy a multi-node Zenoh system using Arm-based hardware or virtual environments.

prerequisites:
    - At least two [Raspberry Pi5 or Pi4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) or other Cortex-A instances with a Linux-based OS installed.
    - Basic understanding with the Linux command line.
    - Experience with ROS 2 applications.
    - Corellium account for virtual hardware testing. (Option)
