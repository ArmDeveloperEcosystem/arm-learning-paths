    draft: true

minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for robotics developers, industrial automation engineers, and IoT system architects building distributed, scalable, and low-latency applications. Whether you are using Robot Operating System (ROS), developing autonomous systems, or designing multi-node communication frameworks, you can use Eclipse Zenoh on Arm-based platforms, both in the cloud and on local devices like Raspberry Pi.

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand Zenoh's architecture and its integration of pub/sub, storage, querying, and computation models.
    - Build and run Zenoh examples on both Arm servers and Raspberry Pi.
    - Set up and deploy a multi-node Zenoh system.

prerequisites:
    - At least two local Cortex-A devices running Linux, such as Raspberry Pi 4 or Pi 5. You can also use Arm servers or cloud instances. 
    - Experience with ROS 2 applications.
