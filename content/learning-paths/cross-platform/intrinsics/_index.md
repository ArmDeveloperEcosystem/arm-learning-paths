title: Porting architecture specific intrinsics

description: Learn how to port architecture-specific intrinsics to Arm processors.

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers interested in porting
  architecture specific intrinsics to Arm processors.

learning_objectives:
- Describe what intrinsics are and how to find them in code.
- Evaluate options and use header-only libraries to port architecture-specific intrinsics
  to Arm.

prerequisites:
- Some understanding of SIMD concepts.
- An Arm based machine or [cloud instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) running Ubuntu Linux.
- Optionally, an `x86_64` machine also running Ubuntu.
