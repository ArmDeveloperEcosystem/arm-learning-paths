    - questions:
        question: >        
            Does the input layer of the model flatten the 28x28 pixel image into a 1D array of 784 elements?
        answers:
            - "Yes"
            - "No"
        correct_answer: 1
        explanation: >
            Yes, the model uses nn.Flatten() to reshape the 28x28 pixel image into a 1D array of 784 elements for processing by the fully connected layers.
    - questions:
        question: >
            Does the model use dropout layers with a 20% dropout rate after each hidden layer?
        answers:
            - "Yes"
            - "No"
        correct_answer: 1
        explanation: >
            Yes, the model applies dropout layers after each hidden layer, randomly setting 20% of the neurons to 0 during training to prevent overfitting. 
    - questions:
        question: >
            Will the model make random predictions if itâ€™s run before training?
        answers:
            - "Yes"
            - "No"
        correct_answer: 1
        explanation: >
            Yes, however in such the case the model will produce random outputs, as the network has not been trained to recognize any patterns from the data.
