    draft: true
who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in learning how to use PyTorch to train a feedforward neural network for digit classification. 

learning_objectives:
    - Download and prepare the MNIST dataset.
    - Train a neural network using PyTorch.

prerequisites:
    - Any computer which can run Python3 and Visual Studio Code, this can be Windows, Linux, or macOS.
    - You should complete [Create a PyTorch model for digit classification](/learning-paths/cross-platform/pytorch-digit-classification-architecture/) before starting this Learning Path.
