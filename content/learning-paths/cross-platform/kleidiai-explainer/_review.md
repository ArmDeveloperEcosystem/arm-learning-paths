        question: >
            If your ML framework supports KleidiAI, you automatically benefit from its AI workload acceleration.
        answers:
            - True, I don't need to do anything else to enable it.
            - False, I need to manually activate it.
        correct_answer: 1                   
        explanation: >
            Once your ML framework adopts KleidiAI, you will automatically see AI workload acceleration on supported machines.
