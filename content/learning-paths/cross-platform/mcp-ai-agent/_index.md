who_is_this_for: This Learning Path targets LLM and IoT developers who are familiar with Large Language Model (LLM) concepts and networking. You will learn how to deploy a lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server on a Raspberry Pi 5 and interact with it via the OpenAI-Agent SDK.

learning_objectives: 
    - Deploy a lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server on Raspberry Pi 5
    - Design and register custom tools for the AI Agent
    - Create custom endpoints
    - Learn about uv â€” a fast, efficient Python package manager

prerequisites:
    - A [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/)
    - Basic understanding of Python and prompt engineering.
    - Understanding of LLM and AI Agent fundamentals
