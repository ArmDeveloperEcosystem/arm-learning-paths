title: "Migrate x86-64 SIMD to Arm64"

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for developers migrating vectorized (SIMD) code from x86-64 to Arm64.

learning_objectives:
     - Identify how Arm vector extensions including NEON, Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), and Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) map to vector extensions from other architectures
     - Plan a migration strategy using autovectorization, intrinsics, or library substitution
   

prerequisites:
    - Familiarity with vector extensions, SIMD programming, and compiler intrinsics
    - Access to Linux systems with NEON and SVE support
