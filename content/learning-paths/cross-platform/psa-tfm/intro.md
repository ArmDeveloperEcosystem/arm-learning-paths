Arm Trusted Firmware provides a reference implementation of Platform Security Architecture (PSA). Reference implementations are available for a number of [platforms](https://tf-m-user-guide.trustedfirmware.org/platform/index.html).

This Learning Path uses the [Corstone-1000](https://www.arm.com/en/products/silicon-ip-subsystems/corstone-1000) platform.

The software stack can be executed on the Corstone-1000 Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) and the MPS3 FPGA prototyping board.

## Corstone-1000 FVP {#fvp}

You can access the FVP with [Arm Virtual Hardware](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/simulation/virtual-hardware). Setup instructions are given in the [Arm Virtual Hardware install guide](/install-guides/avh#corstone).

The Corstone-1000 FVP is also available from the [Arm Ecosystem FVP](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-ecosystem-fvps) page. Setup instructions are given in the [install guide](/install-guides/fm_fvp). Use this for a local (Linux) development environment.


## MPS3 FPGA prototyping board

You can also use [MPS3 FPGA Prototyping Board](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/MPS3%20FPGA%20Prototyping%20Board) programmed with [AN550](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/view/AN550).

The image requires the `QSPI Flash Module` to be installed. Refer to section 8.2 of the [AN550 documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dai0550/latest/).
