# ================================================================================
weight: 1                       # _index.md always has weight of 1 to order correctly
layout: "learningpathall"       # All files under learning paths have this same wrapper
learning_path_main_page: "yes"  # This should be surfaced when looking for related content. Only set for _index.md of learning path content.
