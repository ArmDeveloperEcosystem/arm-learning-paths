Before trying any optimization, it's important to understand the way the data is represented and accessed in memory. In this case, the compiler cannot issue SIMD instructions because the operations are done in triplets (x,y,z) and SIMD operations for 32-bit floating point values require 4 elements.

In order to improve the data layout and help the compiler, you need to go back and look at the `object` struct in more detail. The memory layout of `object` is the following:

![Memory layout #center](memory-layout1.svg "Figure 1. struct object memory layout with vec3")

As the `vec3` types are triplets, their alignment `is 3 x 4 bytes = 12 bytes`. This makes usage of SIMD instructions difficult as they usually operate on data multiples of 16 bytes. Alignment to 16 bytes is also important. You can usually solve this by adding extra bytes in such structures as padding. This results in wasted bytes, but sometimes these can be used for extra information. Even if the extra bytes cannot be used, the performance benefit outweighs the loss in memory.

You may be wondering how padding should be added to the struct. You can convert the `vec3` helper struct to a `vec4` to include an extra 'dimension', such as `t`. 

Make the following change to the code to add the padding:

```C
// Helper struct of a 3D vector with x, y, z, coordinates
typedef struct vec4 {
  float x, y, z, t;
} vec4_t;
```

You also need to change the object struct:

```C
// The object struct
typedef struct object {
...
  vec4_t position;
  vec4_t velocity;
...
} object_t;
```

Also change the function `init_objects()` to initialize the new `t` member:

```C
void init_objects(object_t *objects) {
  // Give initial speeds and positions
  for (size_t i=0; i < N; i++) {
...
    objects[i].position.z = randf(20.0) - 10.0f;
    objects[i].position.t = 0.0f;
...
    objects[i].velocity.y = randf(2.0) - 1.0f;
    objects[i].velocity.t = 1.0f;
  }
}
```

Finally, update the `simulate_objects()` function:

```C
void simulate_objects(object_t *objects, float duration, float step) {
...
  while (current_time < duration) {
    // Move the object in msec steps
    for (size_t i=0; i < N; i++) {
...
      objects[i].position.z += objects[i].velocity.z * step;
      objects[i].position.t += objects[i].velocity.t * step;
    }
    current_time += step;
  }
}
```

The memory layout now looks like this:

![Memory layout #center](memory-layout2.svg "Figure 2. struct object memory layout with vec4")

After making the changes, compile the code again: 

```bash
gcc -O3 simulation1.c -o simulation1
```

Running the new program shows immediate improvement:

```console
./simulation1
```

The new `elapsed time` is less than before:

```output
elapsed time: 12.993359
```

Use `objdump` again to view the new assembly code for the`simulate_objects()` function:

```console
objdump -S simulation1 | less
```

The usage of SIMD instructions is obvious now. You can see that loading is done in quads `ldp q0, q3, [x0]`, then `fmla` is used to do the step multiply-accumulate instruction and it stores the vector directly with `str`:
