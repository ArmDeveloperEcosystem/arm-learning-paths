title: Memory latency for application software developers
draft: true
minutes_to_complete: 40

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for Arm developers who want learn about memory latency and cache usage in application programming. 

learning_objectives: 
    - Explain the importance of memory latency and how to reduce its impact
    - Identify how cache alignment impacts performance
    - Use cache prefetching to improve performance

prerequisites:
    - An Arm computer running Linux with recent version of Clang or GCC installed.
