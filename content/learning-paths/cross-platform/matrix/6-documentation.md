## Add developer documentation

In order for other developers to use our library, although well done code speaks for itself, it's always good to provide some documentation. Fear not, we have done almost all of it, thanks to the weird comment formating we have bee using so far. This formating of the comments allows some tools like doxygen to process the code base and generate documentation in many different formats: LaTex, HTML, ...

## Add user documentation

Deploying the project on a public infrastructure is an important step for others to be able to start reusing it, but also contributing to it.

On top of making the repository public, github actions can be setup to perform regression testing on several platforms.

## What have we achieved so far ?
