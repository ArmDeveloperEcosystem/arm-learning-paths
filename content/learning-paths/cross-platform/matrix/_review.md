        question: >
            Which tool can ease the development, configuration, and build of your C++ project on different platforms?
        answers:
            - Autoconf/automake.
            - CMake.
            - Vim.
            - GNU Emacs.
        correct_answer: 2
        explanation: >
            CMake is often used as the configuration and build infrastructure, from small projects to the largest, such as [LLVM](https://www.llvm.org) or [Qt](https://www.qt.io/). Vim and GNU Emacs are powerful text editors. Autoconf and automake are tools that achieve a similar goal across \*nix platforms.

        question: >
            When should you use unit testing ?
        answers:
            - Once the project is finished, to ensure it works.
            - Right from the start so tests can be added during the development phase and ensure it works bottom up.
            - Testing?  My code is always first time right, and I never introduce bugs!
        correct_answer: 2
        explanation: >
            While the first answer is not factually incorrect, the second approach is best as it's much easier to add test along the way as the functionality is developed.

        question: >
            Is there a requirement to rewrite the operators to support Matrices with different data types?
        answers:
            - Yes
            - No
        correct_answer: 2
        explanation: >
            C++ templates are a powerful feature as they enable generic programming, where code is parameterized by types. This allows to write code once, and let the compiler specialize it for a specific types.
