title: Develop a native C++ library on an Arm-based machine

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for developers who want to learn how to develop a library in modern C++ on Arm, using matrix processing as an example.

learning_objectives:
    - Develop a new C++ library.
    - Test a C++ library, ensuring it does not regress functionally.

prerequisites:
    - An Arm-based computer running Linux, macOS, or Windows.
    - An intermediate understanding of C++ programming.
    - A suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
    - The [CMake](/install-guides/cmake/) build tool.
    - A C++ compiler with C++17 support.
    - A build system [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/).
    - A documentation generator [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).
