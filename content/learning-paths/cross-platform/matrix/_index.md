title: Learn about developing a matrix processing library

minutes_to_complete: 120

who_is_this_for: This is an intermediate topic for developers who are interested in understanding how developing a flexible, yet simple and efficient matrix processing library would look like in modern C++.

learning_objectives:
    - Develop an library
    - Test it, ensuring it does not regress functionally
    - Deploy it, making it easy for others to use it in their own projects
    - Benchmark it, ensuring it does not regress in performance
    - Optimize it

prerequisites:
    - An Arm based computer (Linux, MacOS or Windows based)
    - A recent version of Clang or the GNU compiler (gcc)
    - CMake
    - GNU's Make or Ninja
    - Your favorite text editor (or Visual Studio Code)
