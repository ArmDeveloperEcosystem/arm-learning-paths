Use google micro-benchmarking framework to measure the performances of the core functions of our library. Before one can optimize a piece of code, it's important to be able to assess the current performances, and measure the delta improvements (or regressions) of the complete library. It's just to easy way too make one specific function faster, while regressing several others. On this aspect, micro-benchmarking is to performance what unit-testing is to functional correctness.

## Setup Google benchmark

## Add benchmark

## Measure

## What have we achieved so far ?
