## Learn about unit testing

It's common practice when developing software to create unit tests. While it
might appear unnecessary at the outset, tests provide significant
benefits:

- When adding new functionality, or porting to a new platform, the tests allow developers to feel confident in the process.
- They also inspire confidence in users that the software is at the appropriate level of quality.
- They offer an opportunity to catch regressions.
- They demonstrate how to use the library in practice.
- They create opportunities for those new to the project to easily check their patches, and verify that the introduction of the new code has not created unintended negative changes.
  
You will notice that setting up testing precedes library code development.

There are many unit testing frameworks available, and C++ is not short of them. See this [wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#C++). This particular Learning Path uses [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) as the testing framework.

## Set up GoogleTest

One method you can use is to rely on the operating system platform to provide GoogleTest, then
ask developers to install it on each machine they use, but this is an unnecessary step.

As testing is a cornerstone of your Matrix library development, GoogleTest should be installed automatically as a dependency in the build tree of your project.

One great feature of GoogleTest is that it provides a seamless integration with CMake.

Adding external dependencies is easily done with CMake. This is done with a
separate `CMakeLists.txt` file, placed in the `external/` directory. This file covers
all external dependencies. It will be used by the main `CMakeLists.txt`.

Create the file `external/CMakeLists.txt` with the following content:

{{< include-code TXT "content/learning-paths/cross-platform/matrix/projects/chapter-2/external/CMakeLists.txt" >}}

You might notice a new CMake feature: variables. Variables start with the `$` character and have a name inserted between curly braces. A CMake variable can be set by the CMake itself, or by the user, and they can be modified or used as they are.

In this case, the variable `${EXTERNAL_PROJECT_CMAKE_ARGS}` is set with the options to
pass to CMake for installing the external dependencies:

- `${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}`: the C++ compiler used by CMake
- `${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}`: the type of build used by CMake (`Release`, `Debug`,
  ...)
- `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}`: where CMake will install the project

The project now looks like this:

```TXT
Matrix/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── build/
│   ...
├── external/
│   └── CMakeLists.txt
├── include/
│   └── Matrix/
│       └── Matrix.h
├── lib/
│   └── Matrix/
│       └── Matrix.cpp
└── src/
    ├── getVersion.cpp
    └── howdy.cpp
```

Next, you need to use the new `CMakeLists.txt` in the top level CMake file.

Add the following lines after the Matrix project declaration in the top-level
`CMakeLists.txt`:

```TXT
# ===================================================================
# Download, configure, build and install locally our external dependencies.
# This is done once, at configuration time.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# Build CMake command line so that it will use the same CMake configuration than
# the one we have been invoked with (generator, compiler, build type, build directory)
set(EXTERNAL_PROJECT_CMAKE_ARGS
      -G ${CMAKE_GENERATOR}
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:PATH=${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR})

# Download and configure our external dependencies
execute_process(
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND}
      -S ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/external
      -B ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/external
      ${EXTERNAL_PROJECT_CMAKE_ARGS}
)

# Build our external dependencies.
execute_process(
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} --build ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/external
)
# Install our external dependencies.
execute_process(
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} --install ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/external
)

# Import googletest package information (library names, paths, dependencies...)
set(GTest_DIR "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib/cmake/GTest"
    CACHE PATH "Path to the googletest package configuration files")
find_package(GTest REQUIRED
  CONFIG
  NO_DEFAULT_PATH
  NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH
  NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH
)
```

The variable `${CMAKE_GENERATOR}` is what CMake uses to perform the build, usually GNU
Make or Ninja, but it can be an IDE specific project file as well.

The variable `${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}` is the path to the top level directory of your project where the main `CMakeLists.txt` is located, and `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}` is the build directory.

At configuration time, CMake downloads, builds and installs GoogleTest and
makes it available to your project using `find_package`.

Now if you build the project, CMake notices it has been updated and will perform all necessary steps.

The output below shows that besides the executable, CMake has configured, built, and installed GoogleTest.

Copy and paste the commands to run the build yourself to see the output:

## Add your first test

Now that GoogleTest is available, you can add the first test.

In order to keep the project clean, all tests go inside a `tests/`
directory. One file, `tests/main.cpp`, contains the top level directions for
testing.

As a project might contain many tests, it's good to split them across
several files inside the `tests/` directory.

Create the top-level test in `tests/main.cpp` and paste the following code into the file:

{{< include-code CPP "content/learning-paths/cross-platform/matrix/projects/chapter-2/tests/main.cpp" >}}

Create `tests/Version.cpp` and add the `getVersion` unit test into the file:

{{< include-code CPP "content/learning-paths/cross-platform/matrix/projects/chapter-2/tests/Version.cpp" >}}

This test invokes `getVersion` and checks that the `major`, `minor` and `patch` levels match the expected values.

The last step is to tell CMake about the tests. All tests are linked together in a single `matrix-test` executable (linking with the Matrix library and GoogleTest), and you add a convenience `check` target so the
tests can be run easily.

Add the following at the bottom of the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`:

```TXT
# ===================================================================
# Testing
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
add_executable(matrix-test tests/main.cpp tests/Version.cpp)
target_link_libraries(matrix-test GTest::gtest Matrix)
add_custom_target(check
   COMMAND matrix-test --gtest_color=yes --gtest_output=xml:matrix-test.xml
)
```

Run the build again:

```BASH { output_lines = "3-9" }
cd build
ninja
...
[6/6] Completed 'googletest'
-- Install configuration: "Debug"
-- Configuring done (1.2s)
-- Generating done (0.0s)
-- Build files have been written to: .../chapter-2/build
[3/3] Linking CXX executable matrix-test
```

And run the tests:

```BASH { output_lines = "2-12" }
ninja check
...
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from Matrix
[ RUN      ] Matrix.getVersion
[       OK ] Matrix.getVersion (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from Matrix (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

Congratulations, your first unit test of the Matrix library passes!

## What have you achieved so far?

Your directory structure now looks like this:

...

└── tests/
    ├── Version.cpp
    └── main.cpp
```

You can download the [archive](/artifacts/matrix/chapter-2.tar.xz) of the project in its current state to experiment on your computer.

CMake makes it easy to use GoogleTest as an external project. Adding unit tests as you go is now easy.

You have created the unit testing environment for your Matrix library and added a test. The infrastructure is now in place to implement the core of the Matrix processing library.
