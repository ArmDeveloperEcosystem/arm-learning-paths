## Where Should We Start?

Start by logging into your GitLab account or create a new one in the [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) main page.

We will need to a new project/repo that will contain all our project files including our **`CI/CD`** pipeline configuration file. 

We can also choose to use any previously created projects in our Gitlab account. Simply open your previously created project. If that is the case then skip the rest of the steps in the current page and move to the next steps in this tutorial.

1. From the Home page, Click on the **`Projects`** icon from the menu on the left hand side panel as the image below.
