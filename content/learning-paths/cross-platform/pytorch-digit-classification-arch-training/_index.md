title: Create and train a PyTorch model for digit classification

minutes_to_complete: 160

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers interested in learning how to use PyTorch to create and train a feedforward neural network for digit classification. You will also learn how to use the trained model in an Android application. Finally, you will apply model optimizations.

learning_objectives:
    - Prepare a PyTorch development environment.
    - Download and prepare the MNIST dataset.
    - Create a neural network architecture using PyTorch.
    - Train a neural network using PyTorch.
    - Create an Android app and loading the pre-trained model.
    - Prepare an input dataset.
    - Measure the inference time.
    - Optimize a neural network architecture using quantization and fusing.
    - Use an optimized model in the Android application.

prerequisites:
    - A computer that can run Python3, Visual Studio Code, and Android Studio. The OS can be Windows, Linux, or macOS.
