title: Create and train a PyTorch model for digit classification using the MNIST dataset

minutes_to_complete: 160

who_is_this_for: This is an advanced topic for software developers interested in learning how to use PyTorch to create and train a feedforward neural network for digit classification, and also software developers interested in learning how to use and apply optimizations to the trained model in an Android application.

learning_objectives:
    - Prepare a PyTorch development environment.
    - Download and prepare the MNIST dataset.
    - Create and train a neural network architecture using PyTorch.
    - Create an Android app and load the pre-trained model.
    - Prepare an input dataset.
    - Measure the inference time.
    - Optimize a neural network architecture using quantization and fusing.
    - Deploy an optimized model in an Android application.

prerequisites:
    - A machine that can run Python3, Visual Studio Code, and Android Studio. 
    - For the OS, you can use Windows, Linux, or macOS.
