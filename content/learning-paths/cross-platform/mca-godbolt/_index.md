title: Learn about LLVM Machine Code Analyzer

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who want to diagnose performance issues of Arm programs using LLVM Machine Code Analyzer (MCA) and Compiler Explorer.

learning_objectives:
    - Estimate the hardware resource pressure and the number of cycles taken to execute your code snippet using llvm-mca.
    - Describe how this estimate can help diagnose possible performance issues.
    - Use Compiler Explorer to run llvm-mca.

prerequisites:
    - Familiarity with Arm assembly.
    - LLVM version 16 or newer, which includes support for Neoverse V2.
