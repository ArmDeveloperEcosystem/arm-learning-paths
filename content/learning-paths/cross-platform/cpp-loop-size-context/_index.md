title: Boost C++ performance by optimizing loops with boundary information

minutes_to_complete: 15

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for C++ developers who want to improve the runtime of loops using existing knowledge of the loop size.

learning_objectives: 
    - Learn how to communicate loop size constraints to the compiler for better optimization.
    - Understand how providing compile-time context can improve runtime performance.
    - Implement techniques to express loop boundaries that enable better code generation.
    - Compare and analyze the performance impact of providing loop size context.

prerequisites:
    - An Arm computer running Linux. You can also use a virtual machine from a [cloud service provider](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/).
