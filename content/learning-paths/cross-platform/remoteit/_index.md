title: Access remote devices with Remote.It

minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to use Remote.It to establish private network connections between users and devices or devices to device.

learning_objectives:
    - Install Remote.It on target devices (devices you would like to access remotely)
    - Access your Remote.It enabled devices from anywhere
    - Understand the different types of network connections (proxy vs. Peer to peer)

prerequisites:
    - A Windows, macOS, or Linux computer which you will use to configure your devices as well as connect to your remote devices.
    - A device/computer to which you would like remote access. A device can be a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer including development kits such as Raspberry Pi or cloud-hosted such as within Arm Virtual Hardware or within AWS. You will need a method to control this device before Remote.It is deployed which can be local access or access via another remote connectivity solution (Remote Desktop, VPN, etc.)
    - Determine if your device that you would like to access remotely also needs to make connections to other Remote.It devices.
