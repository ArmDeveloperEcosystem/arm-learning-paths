title: Accelerate Matrix Multiplication Performance with SME2

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is an advanced topic for developers who want to learn about accelerating the performance of matrix multiplication using Arm's Scalable Matrix Extension Version 2 (SME2).

learning_objectives:
    - Implement a reference matrix multiplication without using SME2.
    - Use SME2 assembly instructions to improve the matrix multiplication performance.
    - Use SME2 intrinsics to improve the matrix multiplication performance using the C programming language.
    - Compile and run code with SME2 instructions.

prerequisites:
    - Basic knowledge of Arm's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME).
    - Basic knowledge of Arm's Scalable Vector Extension (SVE). 
    - An intermediate understanding of C programming language and assembly language.
    - A computer running Linux, MacOS, or Windows.
    - Installations of Git and Docker.
    - An emulator to run code with SME2 instructions.
    - A compiler with support for SME2 instructions.
