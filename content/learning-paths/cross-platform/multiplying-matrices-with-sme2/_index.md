title: Accelerate Matrix Multiplication Performance with SME2

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is an advanced topic for developers who want to accelerate the performance of matrix multiplication using Arm's Scalable Matrix Extension Version 2 (SME2).

learning_objectives:
    - Implement a baseline matrix multiplication kernel in C without SME2
    - Use SME2 assembly instructions to accelerate matrix multiplication performance
    - Use SME2 intrinsics to vectorize and optimize matrix multiplication
    - Compile code with SME2 intrinsics and assembly
    - Benchmark and validate SME2-accelerated matrix multiplication on Arm hardware or in a Linux-based emulation environment
    - Compare performance metrics between baseline and SME2-optimized implementations

prerequisites:
    - Working knowledge of Armâ€™s SVE and SME2 instruction sets
    - Intermediate proficiency with the C programming language and the Armv9-A assembly language
    - A computer running Linux, macOS, or Windows
    - Installations of Git and Docker for project setup and emulation
    - A platform that supports SME2 - see the list of [devices with SME2 support](/learning-paths/cross-platform/multiplying-matrices-with-sme2/1-get-started/#devices) or an emulator to run code with SME2 instructions
    - Compiler support for SME2 instructions (for example, LLVM 17+ with SME2 backend support)
