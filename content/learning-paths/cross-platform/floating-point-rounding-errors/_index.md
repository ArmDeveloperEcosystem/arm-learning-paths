title: Learn about floating point rounding on Arm

draft: true
cascade:
    draft: true

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: Developers porting applications from x86 to Arm who observe different floating point values on each platform.

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand the differences between floating point numbers on x86 and Arm. 
    - Understand factors that affect floating point behavior.
    - How to use compiler flags to produce predictable behavior.

prerequisites:
    - Access to an x86 and an Arm Linux machine.
    - Basic understanding of floating point numbers.
