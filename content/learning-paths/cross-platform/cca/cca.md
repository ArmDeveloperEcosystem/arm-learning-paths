[Arm Confidential Compute Architecture ](https://www.arm.com/architecture/security-features/arm-confidential-compute-architecture) (`CCA`) is a system solution consisting of hardware and software components to maximize the security of your data on devices and cloud.

CCA enhances the virtualization capabilities of your platform by seperating management of resources from access to those resources.

For a detailed explanation of CCA, review the [Learn the Architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0125/) documentation.

## Realm Management Extension (RME)

`RME` is the principal hardware Armv9-A architectural feature to enable CCA. This provides an isolated execution environment (a `Realm`) where sensitive data can reside, inaccessible to all code outside of that Realm.

For a detailed explanation of RME, review the [Learn the Architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0126) documentation.
