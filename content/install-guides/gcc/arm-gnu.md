## Before you begin

Arm GNU Toolchain is a community supported, pre-built GNU compiler toolchain for Arm based CPUs.
There are many versions of the [Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain) available. In general, the latest version is recommended for use, as this will contain the latest optimization improvements, as well as support for the latest Arm IP.

However there are reasons you may wish to use earlier compiler versions, so older versions are also available.

## Download toolchain {#download}

Arm GNU Toolchain releases consist of cross toolchains for the following host operating systems:
    
Linux    
  * Available for x86_64 and AArch64 host architectures
  * Available for bare-metal and Linux targets      
    
Windows    
  * Available for x86 host architecture only (compatible with x86_64)
  * Available for bare-metal and Linux targets
                      
macOS    
  * Available for x86_64 and Apple silicon (beta) host architectures
  * Available for bare-metal targets only
    
Download the correct toolchain variant for your development needs from the [Arm Developer website](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/downloads).

## Installing on Linux

### Use package installer

Many Linux distributions make the toolchain available with their package installers. However they may not be the latest versions or desired variant.
```command
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```
If the installed version does not meet your needs, install [manually](#manual).

### Manual install {#manual}

Unpack the [downloaded](#download) file to the install directory. The exact file name will depend on the flavor selected.

```console
tar xJf arm-gnu-toolchain-<version>-<host-arch>-<TRIPLE>.tar.xz -C /path/to/install/dir
```

Add the `bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable (bash).
```console
export PATH=/path/to/install/dir/bin:$PATH
```

Here is a specific example for an Arm Linux host and the AArch32 bare-metal target.

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/13.3.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-13.3.rel1-aarch64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz
tar xJf arm-gnu-toolchain-13.3.rel1-aarch64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz -C $HOME
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/arm-gnu-toolchain-13.3.rel1-aarch64-arm-none-eabi/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Installing on macOS

Downloads for `macOS` are available as tar files (`.tar.xz`) and package files (`.pkg`). 

### tar files
For `.tar.xz` files, unpack the downloaded file to the install directory.
```console
tar xJf arm-gnu-toolchain-<version>-<host-arch>-<TRIPLE>.tar.xz -C /path/to/install/dir
```

### pkg files
For `.pkg` files use the installer. 
```console
sudo installer -pkg arm-gnu-toolchain-<version>-<host-arch>-<TRIPLE>.pkg -target /
```
### Update PATH
Use a text editor to add the `bin` directory as a new line in `/etc/paths`.
```console
sudo nano /etc/paths
```
For example the path could be: `/Applications/ArmGNUToolchain/13.3.rel1/arm-none-eabi/bin`

The `/etc/paths` file is a list of paths to search.

```console
/usr/local/bin
/System/Cryptexes/App/usr/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/Applications/ArmGNUToolchain/13.3.rel1/arm-none-eabi/bin
```
### Apple Silicon
Here is a specific example for macOS with Apple Silicon and the AArch32 bare-metal target. 

```console
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/13.3.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-13.3.rel1-darwin-arm64-arm-none-eabi.pkg
sudo installer -pkg arm-gnu-toolchain-13.3.rel1-darwin-arm64-arm-none-eabi.pkg -target /
echo '/Applications/ArmGNUToolchain/13.3.rel1/arm-none-eabi/bin' | sudo tee -a /etc/paths
```

## Installing on Windows
Double-click on the installer (e.g. `gcc-arm-_version_--mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.exe`) and follow on-screen instructions.

The installer can also be run on the command line. When run on
the command-line, the following options can be set:
  - `/S` Run in silent mode
  - `/P` Adds the installation `bin` directory to the system `PATH`
  - `/R` Adds Install Folder registry entry for the install.

For example, to install the tools silently, amend users `PATH` and add registry entry:
```console
gcc-arm-<version>--mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.exe /S /P /R
```
The zip package is a backup to Windows installer for those who cannot run the installer. You can unzip the package and then invoke the tools directly. 

## Setting up product license 

Arm GNU Toolchain is open sourced and freely available for use. No licenses need to be set up for use.

To use the Arm GNU Toolchain in conjunction with [Arm Development Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio) you must [register the toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/2022-0/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Register-a-compiler-toolchain).

## Get started 

To verify the installation is correct enter:
```console
arm-none-eabi-gcc -v
```

Additional examples are included in the toolchain installation at:
```console
${install_dir}/share/gcc-arm-none-eabi/samples
```
