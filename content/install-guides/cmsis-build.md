[CMSIS-Build](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/devtools/buildmgr/latest/index.html) is a set of tools to enable IDEs and command-line tools to share the same projects. 

Historically, IDEs have maintained project information in files which are unique to the IDE. Command line users often use tools such as make and cmake to capture project build information. 

CMSIS-Build unifies project information, making it easy to share between IDEs and command line tools. Keil MDK projects can be can be used from the Linux command line.

The instructions below cover how to install, configure, and use CMSIS-Build from the Linux command line. This is useful for developers who prefer Linux and for automated testing driven by scripts on Linux.

CMSIS-Build is developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools) and is part of the [Open-CMSIS-Pack project](https://www.open-cmsis-pack.org/).

Follow the instructions below to install CMSIS-Build on a Linux machine.

## Before you begin

The install instructions are for Ubuntu or Debian Linux, and are the same for the Arm and x86_64 architectures.

Use the `uname` command to identify your architecture:

```console
uname -m
```

Output values can be `aarch64` or `x86_64` 

CMSIS-Build has the following prerequisites: 
- cmake
- ninja
- compiler such as GCC or Arm Compiler for Embedded

Install the prerequisites.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build -y
```

The minimum `cmake` version is 3.18

Print the `cmake` version:

```bash
cmake --version
```

If the `cmake` version from the Linux package manager is less than 3.18 it can be upgraded to a newer version using `snap`.

```bash
sudo apt remove cmake -y
sudo snap install cmake --classic
```

## Download 

Download the latest install file from GitHub. Downloads are provided in the [Releases area](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/releases)

The current version is 1.5.0. 

```console
wget https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/releases/download/tools%2Fbuildmgr%2F1.5.0/cbuild_install.sh
```

## Installation

To install, run the downloaded `cbuild_install.sh` script.

To interactively answer the questions from the installer run the script and respond to the prompts.

```console
bash ./cbuild_install.sh
```

The default installation directory is `./cbuild` Change the installation directory as needed.

The default location for storing CMSIS-Packs is `$HOME/.cache/arm/packs`

All of the compilers are not necessary, just accept the defaults for compilers which are not needed. 

At the end of the installer a message is displayed to source the setup file.

The path will be different based on your selections.

```bash
source /home/ubuntu/cbuild/etc/setup
```

The command to source the setup file can be added to `.bashrc` or `.profile` 

To change any settings after installation, modify the `etc/setup` file. 

To adjust compiler settings after installation, modify the `.cmake` files in `etc`. These files contain paths and other settings for each compiler. 

## Automated Installation

To automate installation a text file with answers can be passed to `cbuild_install.sh`

The inputs are:
- Installation path
- Directory for storing CMSIS PACKS
- Path to Arm Compiler for Embedded
- Path to Arm Compiler 5
- Path to GNU Arm Embedded compiler
- Path to IAR C/C++ Compiler

The input file can be created manually with an editor. Each line in the file represents an input to an interactive prompt. Leave a blank line to accept the default for a prompt.

If the input file creation also needs to be automated use the command below and enter the input for each prompt or leave a blank line to accept the default.

```bash
cat <<EOF >>cmsis.input
./ctools
$HOME/packs
$HOME/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.19



EOF
```

Make sure the directory for the CMSIS Packs exists before running the install.

Run the installer with the input file:

```bash
bash ./cbuild_install.sh < cmsis.input
```

Source the setup file using the location specified in the `cmsis.input` file:

```bash
source /home/ubuntu/ctools/etc/setup
```

## Setting up product license {#license}

CMSIS-Build is open source and freely available for use. No licenses need to be set up for use. Compilers, such as Arm Compiler for Embedded, invoked by CMSIS-Build may require a license.

## Get started {#start}

Test CMSIS-Build by building a simple example.

The executables included in CMSIS-Build are [cbuild.sh](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/devtools/buildmgr/latest/cbuild.html), [cbuildgen](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/devtools/buildmgr/latest/cbuildgen.html) and [cpackget](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/devtools/buildmgr/latest/cpackget.html). Refer to the documentation for more details.

Confirm CMSIS-Build is installed correctly by building a Blinky example.

Get the Blinky example for the NXP LPCXpresso55S69 board.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arm-Examples/Blinky_LPCXpresso55S69_RTX.git
cd Blinky_LPCXpresso55S69_RTX
```

Build it using `cbuild.sh` to confirm CMSIS-Build and the compiler are installed and working.

```bash
cbuild.sh Blinky.cprj  --packs
```

The necessary CMSIS Packs will be installed and the project will be compiled. 

If all goes well `Objects/image.axf` will be produced and no errors will occur.

You are ready to use CMSIS-Build for your projects.
