AWS Copilot CLI is an open source command line interface for running containers on AWS App Runner, Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and AWS Fargate.

It is available for a variety of operating systems and Linux distributions and supports the Arm architecture. 

## Before you begin

This article provides quick solutions to install the latest version of AWS Copilot CLI for Ubuntu on Arm and macOS.

Confirm you are using an Arm computer by running:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
uname -m
```

If you are on Arm Linux the output should be:

```output
aarch64
```

If you are on macOS with Apple Silicon the output should be:

```output
arm64
```

## Download and install AWS Copilot CLI

Copilot requires Docker. Refer to the [Docker](/install-guides/docker/) install guide for installation instructions. 

If you are using Docker on Linux you will need to install QEMU to build container images for both the `arm64` and the `amd64` architectures.

```console
sudo apt-get install qemu-user-static
```

Docker Desktop for macOS includes the ability to build for multiple architectures, so you don't need to do anything extra.

To install Copilot on Arm Linux:

```console
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/copilot https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/releases/latest/download/copilot-linux-arm64 \
   && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/copilot \
   && copilot --help
```

To install Copilot on macOS:

```console
curl -Lo copilot https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/releases/latest/download/copilot-darwin && chmod +x copilot && sudo mv copilot /usr/local/bin/copilot && copilot --help
```

The help message is printed:
