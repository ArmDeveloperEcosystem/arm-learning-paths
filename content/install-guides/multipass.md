[Multipass](https://multipass.run/) provides cloud style virtual machines (VMs). Multipass is popular among developers for efficient, local testing. When run on macOS with Apple Silicon, Multipass provides a similar experience to cloud instances. A local, software compatible equivalent of an Arm cloud instance on your desk with good performance, and no cost, is an important option for developers. 

Multipass provides a clear CLI to easily start virtual machine instances, do development tasks, and clean the VMs from your computer.

## Before you begin

Multipass runs on a variety of platforms and host operating systems. The information below covers running Multipass on macOS with Apple Silicon with the goal of creating a compatible Ubuntu Linux environment for developers working on cloud instances. 

Multipass uses the terms virtual machine and instance synonymously. 

## Download  {#download}

Download Multipass for macOS.

```console
wget https://github.com/canonical/multipass/releases/download/v1.10.1/multipass-1.10.1+mac-Darwin.pkg
```

## Installation

Install the download using the package command.

```console
sudo installer -pkg  multipass-1.10.1+mac-Darwin.pkg -target /
```

The getting started instructions below use the command line interface. Multipass installs a tray icon for those who want to access basic features from the user interface.

## Get started with Multipass

To confirm multipass is installed run the `version` command.

```console
multipass version
```

Multipass runs Ubuntu images. The last three LTS (long-term support) versions are available. A Docker environment with Portainer is also available as well as a few other images.

To see the available images run the `find` command. Any of the listed images can be used to create a new instance.

```console
multipass find 
```
The output from `find` will be similar to the below.

```output
Image                       Aliases           Version          Description
18.04                       bionic            20230112         Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
20.04                       focal             20230111         Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
22.04                       jammy,lts         20230107         Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

minikube                                      latest           minikube is local Kubernetes
```

### Launching instances

The default values for launching instances allocate 1 CPU, create a small disk (5 Gb), and limited memory (1 Gb). By default, the name of the instance is automatically assigned. 

Most developers are likely to want to modify the defaults. 

Use the command below to launch a virtual machine instance with non-default values.

```console
multipass launch lts --name m1u --cpus 4 --disk 16G --memory 4G
```

Once launched, the command prompt returns and the instance is running in the background.

### Connect and use instances

Use the `list` command to identify created instances. Make note of the instance names as the name is used in other commands.

```console
multipass list
```

To start a command line shell on a running instance use the `shell` command.

```console
multipass shell m1u
```

To run a specific command from the host on the instance use the `exec` command. The command to be run comes after the ``--``

```console
multipass exec m1u -- uname -a
```

The `uname` output will look similar to:

```output
Linux m1u 5.15.0-58-generic #64-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 5 12:06:43 UTC 2023 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux
```

### Run an application

It's helpful to demonstrate a few other common commands by downloading and installing an application. To demonstrate file copy, the download is done from macOS and the file is copied into the instance.

Download and install [OpenVSCode Server](/install-guides/openvscode-server/).

On the macOS host computer use `wget` for the download.

```console
wget https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server/releases/download/openvscode-server-v1.72.2/openvscode-server-v1.72.2-linux-arm64.tar.gz
```

To copy a file to the instance

```console
multipass transfer openvscode-server-v1.72.2-linux-arm64.tar.gz m1u:/home/ubuntu
```

Now switch to the instance and extract the download and run the application. 

If you don't already have an open shell run.

```console
multipass shell m1u
```

Extract the download. 

```console
tar xvfz openvscode-server-v1.72.2-linux-arm64.tar.gz
```

Run the application.

```console
./openvscode-server-v1.72.2-linux-arm64/bin/openvscode-server --host=0.0.0.0 --without-connection-token
```

Connect to OpenVSCode Server using a browser. From the macOS host computer use the `info` command to get the IP address of the instance.

The `info` command prints information about the instance, including the IP address.

```console
multipass info m1u
```

Copy the IP address from the info output and paste it into a browser with port 3000.

Modify the IP address to use your information, for example:
```output
http://192.168.64.39:3000
```

You now have a running VS Code Server in your Multipass instance with Ubuntu 22.04 running on Arm.

### Mount a host directory

To access a large number of files on the host machine without copying or transferring them into the instance use the `mount` command. This command makes a host directory visible in the instance and all files can be accessed. Modifications made from inside the instance will directly change the files on the host.

For example, to mount a host directory called `dev` and have it appear in the instance use the `mount` command.

```console
multipass mount dev m1u:/home/ubuntu/dev
```

There are also options to adjust the user and group IDs as needed to avoid permission problems. 

Use the `umount` command to unmount the directory.

```console
multipass umount m1u:/home/ubuntu/dev
```

Directories can be dynamically mounted and unmounted without stopping the instance.

### Stop and Start

Multipass instances can be stopped and started quickly. 

To stop the instance.

```console
multipass stop m1u
```

Following the stop the state will change to Stopped on the list command.

To start the instance.

```console
multipass start m1u
```

### Cleanup

Multipass instances are easy to delete. There is one extra level of protection to recover deleted instances before they are fully deleted. 

Use the `delete` command to delete. 

```console
multipass delete m1u
```
After delete, the state will change to Deleted, but it is still recoverable.

```console
multipass recover m1u
```
Use the `purge` command to permanently remove all deleted instances.

```console
multipass purge 
```
{{% notice Note %}}
Purged instances are no longer recoverable.
