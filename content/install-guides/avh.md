[Arm Virtual Hardware](https://avh.arm.com/) delivers test platforms for developers to verify and validate embedded and IoT applications during the complete software design cycle. Multiple modeling technologies are provided that remove the complexity of building and configuring board farms. This enables modern, agile, cloud native software development practices, such as continuous integration and continuous development CI/CD (DevOps) and MLOps workflows.

There are currently two families of Arm Virtual Hardware. Click the link, or scroll down, for info on how to get started.

- [Arm Virtual Hardware Corstone](#corstone) uses Arm Fast Model technology to create virtual platforms in a cloud instance.
- [Arm Virtual Hardware 3rd Party](#thirdparty) uses hypervisor technology to model real hardware provided by Arm's partners.

## Arm Virtual Hardware Corstone {#corstone}

A valid [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) is necessary. 

Arm Virtual Hardware (AVH) is available as an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI) on [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-urbpq7yo5va7g). You can subscribe to the AMI, and launch in your AWS console. You can also locate it directly from the `Images` > `AMIs` section of your console, by searching for `armvirtualhardware`.

A `c5.large` instance type is recommended for AVH.

Information about launching an AWS instance is available in the [Getting Started with AWS](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/aws/) install guide.

### Connect to instance terminal via SSH

On your local machine, run the following command to connect to the instance (with user name `ubuntu`) with SSH Key `your_key.pem`.
```console
ssh  -i <path_to>/your_key.pem ubuntu@<AMI_IP_address>
```
### Verify instance has launched successfully

In your SSH terminal, run the `tool-inventory.sh` script to verify the instance has launched successfully, and component tools are available for use.
```console
./tool-inventory.sh
```
### Enable Code Server (Visual Studio Code)  {#vscode}
To enabling access to Visual Studio Code with a web browser, you will need to start a SSH tunnel to the instance and forward port `8080`.

```console
ssh -i <key.pem> -N -L 8080:localhost:8080 ubuntu@<AMI_IP_addr>
```
You can then access the IDE via a web browser on your local machine at:
```console
http://localhost:8080
```
### Enable Virtual Network Computing (VNC) {#vnc}

In the AVH terminal, enable and set VNC password (you do not need to enter a view-only password when prompted):

```console
vncpasswd
```

Start the VNC server for the session:

```console
sudo systemctl start vncserver@1.service
```

On your local machine, forward port `5901`.

```console
ssh -I <key.pem> -N –L 5901:localhost:5901 ubuntu@<AMI_IP_addr>
```

Connect your VNC client to port `5901`. You will be prompted for the VNC password.

### Example projects

A number of [example](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/examples/html/index.html) projects are available to further help you get started.

### Use of FVP_Corstone-1000

When using the supplied `FVP_Corstone-1000`,  you must disable the Cryptocell component therein, else you will see a licensing error.

To do this, add the parameter `se.cryptocell.DISABLE_DEVICE=1` to your launch command:

```console
FVP_Corstone-1000 -C se.cryptocell.DISABLE_DEVICE=1  ...
```

## Arm Virtual Hardware 3rd Party {#thirdparty}

A valid [Arm AVH account](https://www.arm.com/resources/contact-us/virtual-hardware-boards) is required.

When you login to the [AVH Dashboard](https://app.avh.arm.com) you can create virtual devices based on a growing library of real devices and boards from Arm partners. Supported targets include:

* STMU5 IoT Discovery Kit
* Raspberry Pi 4
* i.MX 8M Plus
* i.MX 93

A selection of [Quickstart Guides](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/107660/latest/Getting-Started) are provided to launch the platforms with ready made example images.
