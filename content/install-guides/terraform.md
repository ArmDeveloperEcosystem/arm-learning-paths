[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) automates cloud infrastructure. It is an infrastructure as code tool. 

Terraform is available for Windows, macOS, Linux and supports the Arm architecture. 

## Introduction

[General installation information](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) is available which covers all supported operating systems. 

This article provides a quick solution to install Terraform for Ubuntu on Arm.

Confirm you are using an Arm machine by running:
```bash
uname -m
```
The output should be:
```output
aarch64
```

If you see a different result, you are not using an Arm computer running 64-bit Linux.

## Download and Install

The easiest way to install Terraform for Ubuntu on Arm is to use the zip file and copy the executable. 

The installation options with the Ubuntu package manager at time of writing do not work well, but please try them as they may improve. 

Make sure `unzip`, `curl`, and `wget` are available.

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
sudo apt install -y unzip curl wget
```

Download and install the latest version. There is just one executable to copy to the desired location.

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
TER_VER=`curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/terraform/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d \"\,\v | awk '{$1=$1};1'`
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/${TER_VER}/terraform_${TER_VER}_linux_arm64.zip
unzip terraform_${TER_VER}_linux_arm64.zip
sudo cp terraform /usr/local/bin/
```

Confirm the executable is available.

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
terraform version
```
