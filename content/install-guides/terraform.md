[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) automates cloud infrastructure. It is an infrastructure as code tool.

Terraform is available for Windows, macOS, Linux and supports the Arm architecture.

## Before you begin

[General installation information](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) is available which covers all supported operating systems.

This guide provides a quick solution to install Terraform for Ubuntu on Arm and macOS on Apple Silicon.

Confirm you are using an Arm machine by running:

```bash
uname -m
```

For Linux, the output should be:

```output
aarch64
```

For macOS, the output should be:

```output
arm64
```

## Download and install Terraform for Ubuntu

The easiest way to install Terraform for Ubuntu on Arm is to use the zip file and copy the executable.

The installation options with the Ubuntu package manager at time of writing do not work well, but please try them as they may improve.

Make sure `unzip`, `curl`, and `wget` are available.

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
sudo apt install -y unzip curl wget
```

Download and install the latest version. There is just one executable to copy to the desired location.

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
TER_VER=`curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/terraform/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d \"\,\v | awk '{$1=$1};1'`
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/${TER_VER}/terraform_${TER_VER}_linux_arm64.zip
unzip terraform_${TER_VER}_linux_arm64.zip
sudo cp terraform /usr/local/bin/
```

## Download and install Terraform for macOS

If you have [brew](https://brew.sh/) installed, installing Terraform for macOS is simple as:

```console
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```

If you don't have brew installed or prefer to directly install via binary, you can download [Terraform for ARM64](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install#darwin) directly from the Terraform website.

## Run the Terraform executable and print the version

After installing, you can enter the following command to verify the installation:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
terraform version
```

The output will be similar to the output shown below.

For Linux:

```output
Terraform v1.10.5
on linux_arm64
```

For macOS:

```output
Terraform v1.10.5
on darwin_arm64
```

You are now ready to use Terraform.
