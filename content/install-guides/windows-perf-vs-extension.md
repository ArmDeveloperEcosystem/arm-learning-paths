WindowsPerf is a lightweight performance profiling tool inspired by Linux Perf, and designed specifically for Windows on Arm. 

The WindowsPerf GUI is a Visual Studio 2022 extension that provides an intuitive, integrated experience within the Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The extension enables developers to interact with WindowsPerf, adjust settings, and visualize performance data seamlessly in Visual Studio.

1. Install [Visual Studio 2022](/install-guides/vs-woa/) on your Windows on Arm device.
2. Install WindowsPerf using the [WindowsPerf install guide](/install-guides/wperf/).
3. Install the LLVM toolchain using the [LLVM toolchain for Windows on Arm install guide](/install-guides/llvm-woa/).

To build the source code, clone [the repository](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/vs-extension.git) using Git. 

```console
git clone https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/vs-extension.git
```

Double click the `WindowsPerfGUI.sln` solution file to open the project Visual Studio.

Open the `Build` menu and select `Build Solution` to create `WindowsPerfGUI.dll` and `WindowsPerfGUI.vsix`. You can replace the currently installed files with these files to try any changes you have made.

### WindowsPerf Setup

After the extension is installed, you must link the extension with the `wperf.exe` file by navigating to `Tools > Options > WindowsPerf > WindowsPerf Path` in Visual Studio.

Use the `Select` button to navigate to your `wperf.exe` and the `Validate` button to confirm the executable is found.

This step is crucial for utilizing the extension, and the extension will not work without this configuration.

## Overview of key features

The WindowsPerf extension is composed of several key features, each designed to streamline the user experience:

* WindowsPerf Configuration: Connect directly to `wperf.exe` for a seamless integration. 
* Host Data: Understand your environment by selecting `Tools` then `WindowsPerf Host Data`. 
* Output Logging: All commands executed through the GUI are logged, ensuring transparency and aiding with performance analysis.
* Sampling UI: Customize your sampling experience by selecting events, setting frequency and duration, choosing programs for sampling, and comprehensively analyzing results. 

The sampling interface is shown below:
