This guide is intended to get you up and running with the [Arm Virtual Hardware (AVH) Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs)](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/simulation/virtual-hardware) on MacOS. For a thorough review of all options, refer to the offical documentation.

## Prerequisites

[Install Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

If this is for commercial use, you might require a paid subscription.

## Clone the repo

Open a terminal and set the working directory to the location in which you would like to store the Fast Model. Then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Arm-Examples/FVPs-on-Mac.git
```

This creates the subdirectory `FVPs-on-Mac` in the current working directory.

## Build the Docker wrapper

Run the build script to create the Docker image and populate the `bin` folder with model wrappers:

```sh
./build.sh
```


When this completes, inspect the created `bin` folder containing symlinks to `fvp.sh`.
These wrappers can be used exactly like any native model executable:

```sh
./bin/FVP_MPS2_Cortex-M3 --version
```

## Expose models to local environment

Add `$(pwd)/FVPs-on-Mac/bin` to `PATH` environment:

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/FVPs-on-Mac/bin
```

Put this to your `~/.zshrc` to make it permanent.

For further information, refer to the [repository's README.md file](https://github.com/Arm-Examples/FVPs-on-Mac).
