Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

It is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, making it a versatile and widely-used language.

## Is Java available for Arm Linux?

Yes, there are numerous ways to install Java on Arm Linux distributions. 

Below are some of the common methods to install Java. This includes both the Java runtime environment (JRE), which is used to run Java applications and the Java development kit (JDK) which is used to create Java applications.

Pick the one that works best for you.

{{% notice Note %}}
The Java Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) is a test suite that verifies whether a Java implementation conforms to the Java SE Platform Specification. It's a crucial tool for ensuring that Java applications can run consistently across different platforms and implementations.

Check the [OCTLA Signatories List](https://openjdk.org/groups/conformance/JckAccess/jck-access.html) to see who has been granted access to the TCK.

## How do I install Amazon Corretto?

Amazon Corretto is a no-cost distribution of the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK). It is maintained and supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

You can install Corretto using `apt` with the commands:

```console
wget -O - https://apt.corretto.aws/corretto.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/corretto-keyring.gpg && \
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/corretto-keyring.gpg] https://apt.corretto.aws stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/corretto.list
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -y java-21-amazon-corretto-jdk
```

More installation options for Corretto are available in the [Amazon Corretto 21 Guide for Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-21-ug/linux-info.html)

## How do I install the Microsoft Build of OpenJDK?

The Microsoft Build of OpenJDK is a no-cost, open source distribution of OpenJDK. It includes Long-Term Support (LTS) binaries for Java 11 and Java 17 and runs on Arm Linux.

{{% notice Note %}}
The Arm architecture is not available in the repositories for the `apt` package manager. 
{{% /notice %}}

You can download a tar.gz file from [Download the Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/java/openjdk/download)

For example:

```console
wget https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-21.0.4-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
```

Extract the contents of the file:

```console
tar xvf microsoft-jdk-21.0.4-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
```

Move the contents to a directory of your choice: 

```console
sudo mv  jdk-21.0.4+7/ /usr/local
```

Set up environment variables to locate your installation:

```console
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk-21.0.4+7
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Add the environment variables to your `~/.bashrc` file to set them permanently.

For more information about the available versions and supported platforms refer to [About the Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/java/openjdk/overview).

## How do I install Eclipse Temurin from the Adoptium Working Group?

The Adoptium Working Group promotes and supports high-quality, TCK certified runtimes and associated technology for use across the Java ecosystem. 

Eclipse Temurin is the name of the OpenJDK distribution from Adoptium.

To install Temurin on Ubuntu run:

```console
sudo apt install -y wget apt-transport-https gpg
wget -qO - https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/api/gpg/key/public | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/adoptium.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/deb $(awk -F= '/^VERSION_CODENAME/{print$2}' /etc/os-release) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/adoptium.list
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install temurin-17-jdk -y
```

For more information about the available versions and supported platforms refer to [Temurin documentation](https://adoptium.net/docs/).

## How do I install Java from Oracle?

You can download Java from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and install it manually. Look for the files with ARM64 in the description.

Download a [tar.gz](https://download.oracle.com/java/22/latest/jdk-22_linux-aarch64_bin.tar.gz) file from the website. 

Extract the contents of the file:

```console
tar xvf jdk-22_linux-aarch64_bin.tar.gz
```

Move the contents to a directory of your choice: 

```console
sudo mv jdk-22.0.2 /usr/local/
```

Set up environment variables to locate your installation:

```console
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk-22.0.2
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Add the environment variables to your `~/.bashrc` file to set them permanently.

## Can I change the default Java version if multiple versions are installed?

Yes, you can change the default version. For systems with `apt` use:

```console
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

You will be given the option to select a new version. The options are depend on the software currently installed on your computer. 

```output
There are 3 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                           Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-amazon-corretto/bin/java   12100004  auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-arm64/bin/java     1711      manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-amazon-corretto/bin/java   12100004  manual mode
  3            /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-arm64/bin/java     2111      manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:
```

For this case, if you select option 1, Java 17 becomes the default. 

## How do I print the Java version?

Print the version of the Java runtime:

```console
java -version
```

The output will be similar to:

```output
openjdk version "21.0.4" 2024-07-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.4+7-Ubuntu-1ubuntu224.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.4+7-Ubuntu-1ubuntu224.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Print the version of the Java compiler:

```console
javac -version
```

The output will be similar to:

```output
javac 21.0.4
```

## Which version of Java should I use for Arm Linux systems?

For performance and security, itâ€™s important to ensure that your version of Java is at least 11.0.12. Earlier versions lack significant performance improvements. Java performance has steadily increased over time and newer versions will provide better performance.

## Which flags are available for tuning the JVM?

The Java virtual machine (JVM) includes a number of flags which are available to tune performance and aid in debugging. Some of the flags are general purpose and some are Arm architecture specific. 

To print the final values of the flags after the JVM has been initialized run:

```console
java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version
```

## Are there other tools commonly used in Java projects?

There are a number of Java related tools you may want to install.

OS name: "linux", version: "6.8.0-41-generic", arch: "aarch64", family: "unix"
```

### Gradle

Gradle is another build automation tool that is widely used for Java projects. 

It is designed to be highly customizable and flexible, making it suitable for a wide range of projects. 

You can install it from the `apt` package manager:

```console
sudo apt install gradle -y
```

You can also install specific versions by downloading and extracting a zip file:
