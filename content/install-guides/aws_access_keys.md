In this section you will learn how to generate and configure Access keys. Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS.

## Before you begin

Install the AWS CLI on your machine using the [install guide](/install-guides/aws-cli/).

## Generate Access keys (access key ID and secret access key)

Go to My Security Credentials

![aws1 #center](https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/arm-learning-paths/assets/40816837/e1ab1ea2-86a0-404e-be52-629f9f1a9695)

On Your Security Credentials page click on `Create access key`

![aws2 #center](https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/arm-learning-paths/assets/40816837/a5d9dcd7-640d-44ee-9bc8-791c10796b13 "Access keys")


Copy the `Access key ID` and `Secret access key`

![aws3 #center](https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/arm-learning-paths/assets/40816837/699c3643-f979-4548-81f9-4300828b6a06 "Copy keys")


## Configure the AWS CLI

Run the following command to set up your AWS CLI:

```console
aws configure
```
The output from the command will be similar to:

```output
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [****************OAGK]: AXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS Secret Access Key [****************t3iE]: uXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Default region name [us-east-2]: us-east-2
Default output format [json]: json
```

Replace the value of `Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key`, `region name` and `output format` with your unique values.

After a successful configuration, you will be able to use the AWS CLI and automation tools like [Terraform](../terraform) from the terminal.
