You can install the Arduino IDE and Arduino core software for the Raspberry Pi Pico and the Raspberry Pi Pico W. 

Arduino core is the software stack that powers Arduino devices and development boards. While the Raspberry Pi Pico isn't an Arduino board, it uses the same RP2040 SoC as the Arduino RP2040 Connect, and therefore can run the same Arduino core software.

## Install Arduino IDE

First, you need to install the Arduino IDE on your laptop or desktop. You can download it for your operating system from [the Arduino Software website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Follow the provided instructions for installing the IDE.

Start the IDE by clicking the Arduino IDE icon. 

## Install board support package

The Arduino software is comprised of the core libraries and a Board Support Package that is specific to your device. You need to install the `Arduino Mbed OS RP2040 Boards` package to support the Raspberry Pi Pico.

You can install this package by opening the `Boards Manager`.

From the menu select `Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager`.

When the `Boards Manager` opens search for `pico` and the `Arduino Mbed OS RP2040 Boards` will be displayed. Click the `Install` button to add it to the Arduino IDE.

### Raspberry Pi Pico W

The `Boards Manager` package for for `Arduino Mbed OS RP2040 Boards` does not include the Raspberry Pi Pico W. 

If you want to use the Pico W go to `File -> Preferences` (or `Arduino IDE -> Settings` on macOS) and enter the URL below into the `Additional Boards Manager URLs` field: 

```console
https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/releases/download/global/package_rp2040_index.json
```

Return to `Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager` and search for `pico` and you will see a new entry `Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040`. Click the `Install` button to add it to the Arduino IDE.

## Select your board

Once the support package is installed, you need to tell the Arduino IDE which supported board you will be using. From the `Tools -> Board` menu, find and select `Raspberry Pi Pico` or `Raspberry Pi Pico W` depending on your board type.

## Upload to your board

Because the Raspberry Pi Pico doesn't come with the Arduino core software installed, the Arduino IDE won't recognize it. 

To fix that, you must upload a sketch. A sketch is another name for an Arduino software application. 

Go to `File -> Examples -> 01.Basics -> Blink` and load the sketch.

Click the upload button (right arrow icon) and wait for the sketch to be uploaded.

You should see the LED on your Raspberry Pi Pico blink on and off every second.

If you have trouble uploading a sketch, unplug the board, press and hold the `BOOTSEL` button on the board, plug it in, and then release the button.
