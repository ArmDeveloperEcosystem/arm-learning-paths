## What is the Windows Performance Analyzer plugin?

The Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) plugin connects [WindowsPerf](/learning-paths/laptops-and-desktops/windowsperf/) to the Windows Performance Analyzer. Windows Perf is a lightweight performance profiling tool inspired by Linux Perf and designed for Windows on Arm.

Windows Performance Analyzer is a useful tool that supports developers with diagnostics and performance tuning. It generates data tables and graphs of Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events, which are recorded in one of three ways:
- Windows Performance Recorder (WPR)
- Xperf
- or through an assessment that's run in the Assessment Platform.
 
WPA can open event trace log (ETL) files, which you can use for analysis.

The WPA plugin is built using the [Microsoft Performance Toolkit SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-performance-toolkit-sdk), a collection of tools to create and extend performance analysis applications. The plugin parses JSON output from Windows Perf so that it can be visualized in WPA. 

## What are some of the features of the WPA plugin? 

The WindowsPerf GUI extension includes features, which are designed to streamline the user experience:

### Timeline view

The timeline view visualizes the `wperf stat` timeline data plotted by event group:

### Telemetry view

The telemetry view displays telemetry events grouped by unit:

## How do I install the WPA plugin?

Before installing the plugin, you need to make sure you have installed WPA:

### Install WPA

WPA is included in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK), which you can download from [Microsoft](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2243390).

{{% notice Note %}}
The WPA plugin requires WPA version `11.0.7.2` or higher.

Run the downloaded `adksetup.exe` program. 

Specify the default installation location and accept the license agreement. 

Make sure that **Windows Performance Toolkit** is checked under **Select the features you want to install**.

Finally, click **Install**.

### Install the WPA plugin

Now you're ready to install the plugin, which is a single `.dll` file.

Download the `.zip` file from the [Windows Perf WPA plugin GitHub releases page](https://github.com/arm-developer-tools/windowsperf-wpa-plugin/releases) on GitHub.

Alternatively, you can download the latest version using command prompt:

```console
mkdir wpa-plugin
cd wpa-plugin
curl -L -O https://github.com/arm-developer-tools/windowsperf-wpa-plugin/releases/download/1.0.2/wpa-plugin-1.0.2.zip
```

Now extract the `.dll` file from the downloaded `.zip` file. 

```console
tar -xmf wpa-plugin-1.0.2.zip
```

The file `WPAPlugin.dll` is now in your `wpa-plugin` directory. 

There are three ways you can install the `WPAPlugin.dll` file: 

#### 1. Copy the .dll file to the CustomDataSources directory next to the WPA executable.

The default location is: 
        `C:\\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Windows Performance Toolkit\CustomDataSources`

#### 2. Set an environment variable.

Set the `WPA_ADDITIONAL_SEARCH_DIRECTORIES` environment variable to the location of the `.dll` file.

#### 3. Start WPA from the command line and pass the plugin directory location using a flag.

Use the `-addsearchdir` flag for `wpa`:

```bash
wpa -addsearchdir "%USERPROFILE%\plugins"
```
        
## How can I verify the WPA plugin is installed?

To verify the plugin is loaded, launch WPA and the plugin should appear under **Help > About Windows Performance Analyzer**.

## How can I run the WPA plugin from the command line?

To open a JSON file directly from the command line, you can use the `-i` flag to specify the file path to open.

For example: to open `timeline_long.json` in your downloads directory, run the command:

```console
wpa -i "%USERPROFILE%\\Downloads\\timeline_long.json"
```
## How do I uninstall the WPA plugin?

To uninstall the plugin simply delete the `WPAPlugin.dll` file.
