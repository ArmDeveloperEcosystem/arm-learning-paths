[Arm Keil MDK](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Keil%20MDK) is the complete software development environment for a range of Arm Cortex-M based microcontroller devices. MDK includes the µVision IDE and debugger, Arm C/C++ compiler, and essential middleware components. It supports more than 10,000 devices and is easy to learn and use.

## Before you begin

You will need a 64-bit x86 Microsoft Windows machine to run Keil MDK.

Full host platform requirements are given in the [System Requirements](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Keil%20MDK#Editions) section.

## Download installer packages

You can download the installer from the [Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/view/MDK000).

Follow the installation instructions provided in the [µVision User's Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101407/latest/About-uVision/Installation).

## Setting up a license

Arm Keil MDK is license managed. Follow the [license setup instructions](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101454/latest/License-Management).

The MDK-Community license is free for non-commercial use. Visit [keil.arm.com](https://keil.arm.com/mdk-community) to cut your personal license (requires Arm login).

A free 30 day evaluation license for MDK-Professional is also available by completing the [request form](https://www.keil.com/MDKEvaluationRequest/).

## Get started {#start}

To verify everything is installed correctly and to get started with your first project, use an [example project](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101407/latest/Example-Programs).

Once you have copied the example, µVision opens up and you can start working with the project.
