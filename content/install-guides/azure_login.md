In this section you will learn how to authenticate to the Azure environment using the Azure CLI. After log in, the CLI allows you to query and interact with Azure cloud resources.

## Before you begin

Install the Azure CLI on your machine using the [install guide](/install-guides/azure-cli/).

## Sign in interactively

Run the following command to initiate the log in:

```console
az login
```

The output will be similar to what is shown here:

```output
ubuntu@ip-172-31-17-218:~$ az login
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code E5NKJA2HM to authenticate.
```

Open the link in a browser, enter the code that you receive in the above message, and log in into your Azure account. 

You will see the command line details as shown below after you log in.

After a successful log in, you will be able to use the [Azure CLI](../azure-cli) and automation tools like [Terraform](../terraform) from the terminal.
