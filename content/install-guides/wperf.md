WindowsPerf is a Linux Perf-inspired Windows on Arm performance profiling tool. Profiling is based on the Arm AArch64 PMU and its hardware counters. WindowsPerf supports the counting model for obtaining aggregate counts of occurrences of PMU events, and the sampling model for determining the frequencies of event occurrences produced by program locations at the function, basic block, and instruction levels.  WindowsPerf is an open-source project hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/)

WindowsPerf consists of a kernel-mode driver and a user-space command-line tool. You can seamlessly integrate the WindowsPerf command line tool with both the [WindowsPerf Visual Studio Extension](#vs2022) and the [WindowsPerf VS Code Extension](#vscode). These extensions, which you can download from the Visual Studio Marketplace, enhance the functionality of WindowsPerf by providing a user-friendly interface, and additional features for performance analysis and debugging. This integration allows developers to efficiently analyze and optimize their applications directly within their preferred development environment.

You cannot use WindowsPerf on virtual machines, such as cloud instances.

## How do I verify that WindowsPerf is installed correctly? {#verify-install}

You can check everything is working by running the `wperf` executable.

{{% notice  Note%}}
Once you have installed the driver, you can use `wperf` without `Administrator` privileges.

For example:

```command
wperf --version
```

You see output similar to:

```output
        Component     Version  GitVer    FeatureString
        =========     =======  ======    =============
        wperf         4.0.0    b18197bd  +etw-app
        wperf-driver  4.0.0    b18197bd  +etw-drv

```
