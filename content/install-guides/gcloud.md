The Google Cloud CLI, `gcloud`, allows you to run commands in your Google Cloud account.

`gcloud` is available for Windows, macOS, Linux and supports the Arm architecture.

## What should I consider before installing gcloud?

Use the documentation link to find alternative installation options.

This article provides a quick solution to install `gcloud` for Ubuntu on Arm.

Confirm you are using an Arm machine by running:

```bash
uname -m
```

The output should be:

```output
aarch64
```

If you see a different result, you are not using an Arm computer running 64-bit Linux.

## How do I download and install gcloud for Ubuntu on Arm?

### Install gcloud using the package manager 

The easiest way to install `gcloud` for Ubuntu on Arm is to use the package manager.

Download and install the required software packages.

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
sudo apt-get install -y curl apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg
```

Install `gcloud` from the Google repository.

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
echo "deb https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli -y
```

### Install gcloud using the archive file

If you cannot use the package manager or you get a Python version error such as the one below you can use the archive file.

```output
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 google-cloud-cli : Depends: python3 (< 3.12) but 3.12.3-0ubuntu2 is to be installed
```

Download the archive file and extract the contents:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
wget https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-cli-linux-arm.tar.gz
sudo tar -xzf google-cloud-cli-linux-arm.tar.gz -C /opt
```

Run the installer:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
cd /opt/google-cloud-sdk
sudo ./install.sh -q
```

{{% notice Note %}}
You can change the installation directory from `/opt` to a location of your choice. 
{{% /notice %}}

Add the installation directory to your search path. The installer will print the path to a script you can source to add `gcloud` to your search path.

```output
==> Source [/opt/google-cloud-sdk/completion.bash.inc] in your profile to enable shell command completion for gcloud.
==> Source [/opt/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc] in your profile to add the Google Cloud SDK command line tools to your $PATH.

For more information on how to get started, please visit:
  https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts
```

Source the file to include `gcloud` in your search path:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
source /opt/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc
```

Alternatively, you can add the `bin` directory to your path by adding the line below to your `$HOME/.bashrc` file.

```console
export PATH="/opt/google-cloud-sdk/bin:$PATH"
```

## Test gcloud

Confirm the executable is available and print the version:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
gcloud -v
```

The output is similar to:

```output
Google Cloud SDK 418.0.0
alpha 2023.02.13
beta 2023.02.13
bq 2.0.85
bundled-python3-unix 3.9.16
core 2023.02.13
gcloud-crc32c 1.0.0
gsutil 5.20
```

## How do I acquire user access credentials for Google Cloud? {#acquire-user-credentials}

You can use `gcloud` to obtain user access credentials for Google Cloud using a web flow. You will put the credentials in a well-known location for Application Default Credentials (`ADC`).

Run the following command to obtain user access credentials:

```console
gcloud auth application-default login
```

The command outputs a uniquely generated URL and a prompt to enter an authorization code, as shown below:

![gcloud1 #center](https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/arm-learning-paths/assets/40816837/1f6fbbe1-eb08-49b6-bfd5-2b6e54462dc3)

Open the URL in your browser and copy the unique authentication code.

![gcloud2 #center](https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/arm-learning-paths/assets/40816837/71065844-9d98-40be-a746-c0bb498ae913)

Now, paste the authentication code as shown below. The following output indicates a successful log in:

```output
Enter authorization code: 4/0AfgeXvsdW0jpvy3dBg5SH03DryspZyV5nz0j3lIDg4LwjL1AgikjjJYHgWlcap3Xtb0ioA

Credentials saved to file: [/home/ubuntu/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json]

These credentials will be used by any library that requests Application Default Credentials (ADC).
```

After a successful log in, you will be able to use the `Google Cloud CLI` and automation tools like [Terraform](/install-guides/terraform/) from the terminal.
