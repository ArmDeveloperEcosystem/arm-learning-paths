### Linux

Chrome is not available for Arm Linux. 

### Windows

Emulation is slower than native and shortens battery life, but may provide required functionality.

Chrome supports Google account sign-in, bookmark synchronization, and password manager so if you need these features emulated Chrome is useful. 

1. Download the Windows installer from [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

2. Run the `ChromeSetup.exe` installer 

3. Find and start Chrome from the applications menu
