[Arm Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded) is a mature toolchain tailored to the development of bare-metal software, firmware, and Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) applications for Arm.

A safety qualified branch of Arm Compiler for Embedded, known as [Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded%20FuSa), is available for safety critical applications.


## Use the version contained in Arm Development Studio or Keil MDK

The easiest way to access the Arm Compiler for Embedded is to use the version provided with [Arm Development Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio).

A given Development Studio version will contain the latest compiler version available at the time of release, and is generally up to date.

Cortex-M users can also use the compiler as provided with [Keil MDK](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5).

Alternative versions can be [downloaded separately](#download).

Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa must also be [downloaded separately](#download).

## Standalone compiler packages {#download}

Individual compiler packages for all supported host platforms can be downloaded from the [Arm Product Download Hub](#pdh) or the [Arm Tools Artifactory](#artifactory).

Individual compiler packages for all supported host platforms can be downloaded from the [Arm Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads) or the [Arm Tools Artifactory](https://www.keil.arm.com/artifacts/).

### Product Download Hub {#pdh}

All compiler packages can be downloaded from the [Arm Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads) (requires login):

- [Arm Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/view/ACOMPE)
- [Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/view/ACOMP616)

These can either be used standalone or [integrated](#armds) into your Arm Development Studio installation.

See also: [What should I do if I want to download a legacy release of Arm Compiler?](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ka005184)

See [Arm Product Download Hub](/install-guides/pdh/) for additional information on usage.

### Install compiler packages

To install on Windows, unzip the downloaded package, launch the installer, and follow on-screen prompts.
```console
win-x86_64\setup.exe
```
To install on Linux hosts, `untar` the downloaded package and run the install script (note the exact filenames are version and host dependent). For example:

#### x86_64
```console
mkdir tmp
mv ARMCompiler6.22_standalone_linux-x86_64.tar.gz tmp
cd tmp
tar xvfz ARMCompiler6.22_standalone_linux-x86_64.tar.gz
./install_x86_64.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula --no-interactive -d /home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.22
```
#### aarch64
```console
mkdir tmp
mv ARMCompiler6.22_standalone_linux-aarch64.tar.gz tmp
cd tmp
tar xvfz ARMCompiler6.22_standalone_linux-aarch64.tar.gz
./install_aarch64.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula --no-interactive -d /home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.22
```
Remove the install data when complete.
```console
cd ..
rm -r tmp
```
Add the `bin` directory of the installation to the `PATH` and confirm `armclang` can be invoked.
#### bash
```console
export PATH=/home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.22/bin:$PATH
armclang --version
```
#### csh/tcsh
```console
set path=(/home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.22/bin $path)
armclang --version
```

### Arm Tools Artifactory {#artifactory}

The Arm Compiler for Embedded, as well as other tools and utilities are available in the [Arm Tools Artifactory](https://www.keil.arm.com/artifacts/). The Keil Studio VS Code [Extensions](/install-guides/keilstudio_vs/) use the artifactory to fetch and install and the necessary components.

Available packages can also be fetched directly from the artifactory. This is particularly useful for automated CI/CD flows.

```command
wget https://artifacts.tools.arm.com/arm-compiler/6.22/45/standalone-linux-armv8l_64-rel.tar.gz
```

Note that the artifactory packages do not have their own installers. You should manually extract files and configure, for example:
```command
mkdir ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.22
tar xvzf ./standalone-linux-armv8l_64-rel.tar.gz -C ./ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.22 --strip-components=1
rm ./standalone-linux-armv8l_64-rel.tar.gz
export PATH=/home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.22/bin:$PATH
export AC6_TOOLCHAIN_6_22_0=/home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.22/bin
```

## Set up the product license

Arm Compiler for Embedded and Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa are license managed. License setup instructions are available in the [Arm Licensing install guide](/install-guides/license/).

## Verify installation

To verify everything works, compile a simple `Hello World` example.

Use a text editor to copy and paste the code below into a file named `hello.c`:

```C
// hello.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Compile the code with `armclang`:

```console
armclang --target=aarch64-arm-none-eabi hello.c
```

If the the command completes with no errors, the compiler is working.

More information about the example is available in the [Arm Compiler for Embedded User Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100748/latest/Getting-Started/Compiling-a-Hello-World-example).

## Integrate with Arm Development Studio {#armds}

To integrate this compiler with Arm Development Studio, [register](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/latest/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Register-a-compiler-toolchain) the installation and [configure](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/latest/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Register-a-compiler-toolchain/Configure-a-compiler-toolchain-for-the-Arm-DS-command-prompt) the environment to use that version.

Full installation instructions are given in the [documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100748/latest/Getting-Started/Installing-Arm-Compiler-for-Embedded).
