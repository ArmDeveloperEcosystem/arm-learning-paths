## Search for products

The entire catalogue can be searched for by product name or product code. If you do not find the product you are looking for, under the `Product Search` tab, disable the option to `only show products I have access to`.

Some products will require the appropriate permissions for that IP to be set on your account. These products would be licensed directly, or as part of programs such as [Arm Flexible Access](https://www.arm.com/products/flexible-access). Please contact your Arm representative to arrange this if necessary.

Products are also grouped by classification. For example, click on `Software Development Tools` to a see a full list of such items.

You can find a particular product code from [this list](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/product-code-mappings). This is particularly useful if you are searching for older versions of products which may have been grouped with newer ones.

## Download

Assuming you have access to the product, you will be able to download directly from PDH.

Take note of the `Revision` pull down to ensure you are downloading the appropriate version of the item you are downloading. It is recommended to sort this list by `Revision` rather than `Available date.`

The portal uses [IBM Aspera](https://www.ibm.com/products/aspera) to enable high speed, secure, download. If it is your first time using the portal, you may be prompted to install the `IBM Aspera Connect` browser extension. This only has to be done once.

It is also possible to download without the use of Aspera if you prefer, but this will be slower, especially for large download sizes.

## Updates

You will automatically be notified by the system when updates become available for any products that you have downloaded.
