Most Arm commercial tools are license managed. Arm is migrating to user-based licensing (UBL) which greatly simplifies license configuration. It is available for [Arm Success Kits](../successkits/) as well as [Arm Development Studio](../armds).

Success kits are available as `Hardware Success Kits` (`HSK`) or `Software Success Kits` (`SSK`). See the table below for tooling provided. SSK is a subset of HSK.

With UBL, you have unlimited access to all components in the success kit you have enabled. The license is cached locally for up to 7 days, enabling remote or traveling users to access tools without connecting to their license server.

Starting any UBL enabled tool when the server is available will renew the license for 7 more days. This renewal attempt is performed once per 24 hours.

If the license is not renewed within 7 days, it is automatically returned to the pool of available licenses. When you next use a UBL licensed tool, it will automatically attempt to check out a new license.

User-based licensing can be managed with:
* Local License Server (`LLS`), an internally managed license server, likely only accessible from your internal network or VPN.
* Cloud License Server (`CLS`), a license server managed by Arm, accessible from anywhere.

Legacy product versions do not support UBL licensing and use FlexLM [floating licensing](./flexnet) instead. See the below table.

[`1`] Arm Development Studio versions indexed with letters after the period are for those users with access to non-publicly announced IP.

[`2`] A license to run pre-built platforms, including Fixed Virtual Platforms, is provided with SSK. HSK license is necessary to build virtual platforms.

[`3`] Some functionality of Arm Socrates requires an appropriate [Arm IP license](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101400/010710/Setting-up-licensing/Required-licenses), which may also require a [floating license](./flexnet) to be setup.
