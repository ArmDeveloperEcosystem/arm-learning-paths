Users who do not yet have access to UBL licenses will have FlexNet Publisher floating licenses. You will be supplied with license key(s) to generate your license(s).

## Download the latest FlexNet Publisher software

License Administrators should download and install the latest FlexNet Publisher software to your internal license server.
```url
https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/download-flexnet-publisher
```
## Generate license file

Access the [Software Licensing Portal](https://developer.arm.com/support/licensing) to generate your license. You will need the `HOSTID` of the license server and your product license key from Arm.

## End-user set up
Users should set the environment variable `ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE` to map to the location of your license server.
### Windows
```console
set ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE=port@server
```
### Linux
```console
export ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE=port@server
```
## Activate via tools IDE

The license can also be activated in the various Arm tool IDEs.

For example [Arm Development Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio)), via `Help` > `Arm License Manager`.
