[Arm Performance Libraries](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-performance-libraries#documentation) provides developers with optimized math libraries for high performance computing applications on Arm Neoverse based hardware.

These libraries include highly optimized functions for BLAS, LAPACK, FFT, sparse linear algebra, libamath and libastring.
These libraries are free to use and do not require a license. They can be installed either standalone or with your installation of [Arm Compiler for Linux](/install-guides/acfl). This install guide covers the standalone installation.

Arm Performance Libraries are available for use on [Windows 11 on Arm](#windows), [macOS](#macos) (Apple Silicon), and [Linux](#linux) (AArch64) hosts.

## Windows {#windows}

On your Windows 11 Arm machine, go to the [Arm Performance Libraries download page](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-performance-libraries).
Click on the Download Windows section and download the Windows Installer:
`arm-performance-libraries_<version>_Windows.msi`

Double click to open this file and start the Arm Performance Libraries Setup Wizard.

![win_wizard00 #left](/install-guides/_images/armpl_wizard00.png)

Read and accept the End-User License Agreement by clicking the checkbox 'I accept the terms of this License Agreement'.

![win_wizard01 #left](/install-guides/_images/armpl_wizard01.png)

Select a location for the installation on your system. The default is:

`C:\Program Files\Arm Performance Libraries`

![win_wizard02 #left](/install-guides/_images/armpl_wizard02.png)

Click 'Install' and then 'Finish' to complete the installation.

![win_wizard03 #left](/install-guides/_images/armpl_wizard03.png)

![win_wizard04 #left](/install-guides/_images/armpl_wizard04.png)

You can now start linking your application to the Arm Performance libraries on your Windows on Arm device. Follow the examples in the included `RELEASE_NOTES` file of your extracted installation directory to get started.

For more information refer to [Get started with Arm Performance Libraries](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109361).


## macOS {#macos}

[Download](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-performance-libraries) the appropriate package for your macOS distribution.

In a terminal, run the command shown below to download the macOS package:
```console
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/hpc/arm-performance-libraries/24-04/macos/arm-performance-libraries_24.04_macOS.tgz
```

Use tar to extract the file:
```console
tar zxvf arm-performance-libraries_24.04_macOS.tgz
```

Output of above command:
```console
armpl_24.04_flang-new_clang_18.dmg
```

Mount the disk image by running from a terminal:
```console
hdiutil attach armpl_24.04_flang-new_clang_18.dmg
```

Now run the installation script as a superuser:

```console
/Volumes/armpl_24.04_flang-new_clang_18_installer/armpl_24.04_flang-new_clang_18_install.sh -y
```

Using this command you automatically accept the End User License Agreement and the packages are installed to the `/opt/arm` directory. If you want to change the installation directory location use the `--install_dir` option with the script and provide the desired directory location.

To get started, compile and test the examples included in the `/opt/arm/<armpl_dir>/examples/`, or `<install_dir>/<armpl_dir>/examples/` directory, if you have installed to a different location than the default.

For more information refer to [Get started with Arm Performance Libraries](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109362).


## Linux {#linux}

Arm Performance Libraries are supported on most Linux Distributions like Ubuntu, RHEL, SLES and Amazon Linux on an `AArch64` host and compatible with various versions of GCC and NVHPC. The GCC compatible releases are built with GCC 13 and tested with GCC versions 7 to 13. The NVHPC compatible releases are built and tested with NVHPC 24.1.

[Download](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-performance-libraries) the appropriate package for your Linux distribution. The deb based installers can be used on Ubuntu 20 and Ubuntu 22. The RPM based installers can be used on the following supported distributions:

- Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2023
- RHEL-7, RHEL-8, RHEL-9
- SLES-15

The instructions shown below are for deb based installers for GCC users.

In a terminal, run the command shown below to download the debian package:

```console
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/hpc/arm-performance-libraries/24-04/linux/arm-performance-libraries_24.04_deb_gcc.tar
```

Use `tar` to extract the file and then change directory:

```console
tar -xf arm-performance-libraries_24.04_deb_gcc.tar
cd arm-performance-libraries_24.04_deb/
```

Run the installation script as a super user:

```console
sudo ./arm-performance-libraries_24.04_deb.sh --accept
```

Using the `--accept` switch you automatically accept the End User License Agreement and the packages are installed to the `/opt/arm` directory.

If you want to change the installation directory location use the `--install-to` option with the script and provide the desired directory location.

### Setup your environment

Install environment modules on your machine:

```console
sudo apt install environment-modules
```

Set your bash environment to use modules:

```console
source /usr/share/modules/init/bash
```

Set the `MODULEPATH` environment variable to point to the location of the installed modulefiles for Arm Performance Libraries:

```console
export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH:/opt/arm/modulefiles
```

List the available modules:

```console
module avail
```

The output should be similar to:

```output
armpl/24.04.0_gcc
```

Load the appropriate module:

```console
module load armpl/24.04.0_gcc
```

You can now compile and test the examples included in the `/opt/arm/<armpl_dir>/examples/`, or `<install_dir>/<armpl_dir>/examples/` directory, if you have installed to a different location than the default.
