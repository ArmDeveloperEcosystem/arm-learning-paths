The [Arm Performance Libraries](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-performance-libraries#documentation) provide developers with optimized math libraries for high performance computing applications on Arm Neoverse based hardware.

These libraries include highly optimized functions for BLAS, LAPACK, FFT, sparse linear algebra, libamath and libastring.
These libraries are free to use and do not require a license. They can be installed either standalone or with your installation of [Arm Compiler for Linux](/install-guides/acfl). This install guide covers the standalone installation.

Arm Performance Libraries are available for use on [Windows 11 on Arm](#windows), [macOS](#macos) (Apple Silicon), and [Linux](#linux) (AArch64) hosts.

Below are the official documentation references:

## Windows {#windows}

On your Windows 11 Arm machine, go to the [Arm Performance Libraries download page](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-performance-libraries). Click on the Download Windows section. You will be prompted to review and accept the End User License Agreement before you can download the zip file. Click on the `I accept the terms of this License Agreement` checkbox and proceed to `Download` as shown below.

![win_download #center](/install-guides/_images/download-win-armpl_23.10.png)

Open your Windows File Explorer and locate the downloaded `arm-performance-libraries_23.10.zip` file.
Extract the contents of this zip file using the "Extract all" button at the top of the Windows File Explorer.

### Update your system environment variables

Using Windows Search, open `Edit the System Variables` in the `Control Panel`.
On the `Advanced Tab` of the `System Properties` window, click on the `Environment Variables` button.

![sys_prop #center](/install-guides/_images/windows-sys-prop.png)

Add a New variable called `ARMPL_DIR` which should point to the location where you unpacked the Arm Performance Libraries.

![add_var #center](/install-guides/_images/windows-sys-env_23.10.png)

Edit the `Path` variable to add `%ARMPL_DIR%\bin` to the list of existing directories in your path.

![edit_path #center](/install-guides/_images/win-sys-path.png)

You can now start linking your application to the Arm Performance libraries on your Windows on Arm device. Follow the examples in the included `RELEASE_NOTES` file of your extracted installation directory to get started.

For more information refer to [Get started with Arm Performance Libraries (Windows version)
Version 23.10](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109361/2310/?lang=en)

## macOS {#macos}

Go to the Download MacOS section of the [Arm Performance Libraries download page](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-performance-libraries) and download the `dmg` file.
Double-click on the icon of the downloaded package to mount the disk image. Alternatively, open a terminal and run the command below:

```console
hdiutil attach arm-performance-libraries_23.10_macOS.dmg
```

Now run the installation script as a superuser:

```console
/Volumes/arm-performance-libraries_23.10_macOS/arm-performance-libraries_23.10_macOS_install.sh -y
```
Using this command you automatically accept the End User License Agreement and the packages are installed to the `/opt/arm` directory. If you want to change the installation directory location use the `--install_dir` option with the script and provide the desired directory location.

To get started, compile and test the examples included in the `/opt/arm/<armpl_dir>/examples/`, or `<install_dir>/<armpl_dir>/examples/` directory, if you have installed to a different location than the default.

For more information refer to [Get started with Arm Performance Libraries (macOS version)
Version 23.10](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109362/2310/?lang=en)

## Linux {#linux}

Arm Performance Libraries are supported on most Linux Distributions like Ubuntu, RHEL, SLES and Amazon Linux on an `AArch64` host and compatible with various versions of GCC.

[Download](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-performance-libraries) the appropriate package for your Linux distribution and version of GCC from the Download Linux section.

The instructions shown below are for an Ubuntu 22.04 AArch64 Linux Host with GCC version 12.2 installed.

On a terminal, run the command shown below to download the appropriate package:
```command
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/hpc/arm-performance-libraries/23-10/ubuntu-22/arm-performance-libraries_23.10_Ubuntu-22.04_gcc-12.2.tar
```

Use `tar` to extract the file and then change directory:

```command
tar -xf arm-performance-libraries_23.10_Ubuntu-22.04_gcc-12.2.tar
cd arm-performance-libraries_23.10_Ubuntu-22.04/
```
Run the installation script as a super user:

```command
sudo ./arm-performance-libraries_23.10_Ubuntu-22.04.sh -a
```
Using the `-a` switch you automatically accept the End User License Agreement and the packages are installed to the `/opt/arm` directory. If you want to change the installation directory location use the `--install-to` option with the script and provide the desired directory location.

### Setup your environment

Install environment modules on your machine:

```command
sudo apt install environment-modules
```

Set your bash environment to use modules:

```command
source /usr/share/modules/init/bash
```

Set the `MODULEPATH` environment variable to point to the location of the installed modulefiles for Arm Performance Libraries:

```command
export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH:/opt/arm/modulefiles
```

List the available modules:

```command
module avail
```

The output should be similar to:

```output
armpl/23.10.0_gcc-12.2
```

Load the appropriate module:

```command
module load armpl/23.10.0_gcc-12.2
```
You can now compile and test the examples included in the `/opt/arm/<armpl_dir>/examples/`, or `<install_dir>/<armpl_dir>/examples/` directory, if you have installed to a different location than the default.
