[Arm Socrates](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Socrates) is a tool used to select, configure and create Arm IP for easy and error free integration into a System on Chip(SoC).

## Download installer packages

Socrates is a component of [Arm Hardware Success Kits](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/success-kits).

It is available to download via the [Arm Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/view/HWSKT-KS-0002).

You can download Socrates as an individual standalone component, or you can download the complete success kits.

For more information on the Download Hub, refer to the [Arm Product Download Hub install guide](../pdh).

## Installation

Arm Socrates requires a Linux machine running Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 

Full specifications are given in the [Installation Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101400/latest/Setting-up-your-environment/Installation-requirements).

Extract the downloaded software and run the installer. For example:

```command
tar -xf socrates.tar.gz
./ARM-Socrates-1.8.0.1-Linux-x86-64-Install --S --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula
```

Full installation instructions are provided in the [Arm Socrates Installation Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101400).

See also the output of:
```command
./ARM-Socrates-1.8.0.1-Linux-x86-64-Install --help
```

## Set up the product license

Arm Socrates is license managed. License setup instructions are available in the [Arm License install guide](../license/).

Configuration of some Arm IP products require a corresponding license for that IP.

Full details are provided in the [Installation Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101400/latest/Setting-up-licensing), as well as the Release Notes provided within the downloaded tarball.


## Update IP Catalog

You will need to update the `IP Catalog` within the IDE for the first usage.

A short-cut should pop-up, else navigate the menu to `Window` > `Preferences` > `IP Catalog` > `Updates`, and click `Check for updates`.

Click `Install IP Catalog Updates` if needed.

Click `Apply and Close` when complete.


## Get started

To check Socrates has installed correctly, use the `socrates.sh` command or doubleâ€‘click the Socrates icon.

You can run `socrates.sh` directly from the installation location, through an alias to the installation location, or you can add the installation location to your path variable.

There is an `Installation Health Check` script provided that runs the first time that you start the software, or the first time that you run a new version. The script checks that all required dependencies are installed and identifies any common installation problems.

Arm has produced a series of videos to help new users get started and learn how to use the tool.\
They are available on the [Arm YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/arm):
