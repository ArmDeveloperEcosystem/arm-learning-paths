Arm Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs) are provided as a library of ready to use platforms.

{{% notice  Arm Development Tools%}}
An appropriate subset of the FVP library is installed with [Arm Development Studio](/install-guides/armds) and [Keil MDK](/install-guides/mdk) Professional Edition.

## Download installer packages

You can download the FVP library installer from the [Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/view/FM000A). Linux (AArch64 and x86) and Windows (x86 only) hosts are supported.

For more information about the Product Download Hub, refer to the [Product Download Hub installation guide](/install-guides/pdh).

## Install FVP library

### Windows

Unzip the downloaded installation archive.

It is easiest to run the installation wizard (`setup.exe`), and follow on-screen instructions.

### Linux
Unpack the downloaded package, and install the FVP library with the supplied script.
```command
./FVP_ARM_Std_Library.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula --no-interactive
```
For full list of available options, use:
```command
./FVP_ARM_Std_Library.sh --help
```

## Set up the product license

FVPs are license managed. License setup instructions are available in the [Arm Licensing install guide](/install-guides/license).

{{% notice  Arm Development Tools%}}
The FVPs provided with Arm Development Studio and/or Keil MDK Professional Edition use the license of that product, not that of the FVP library.

## Verify installation

To verify everything is working OK, navigate to the install directory, and launch any of the supplied FVP executables. No additional command options are needed.

For example:
```command
./FVP_MPS2/FVP_MPS2_Cortex-M3
```
The FVP will launch, and output text in a terminal similar to:
```output
telnetterminal0: Listening for serial connection on port 5000
telnetterminal1: Listening for serial connection on port 5001
telnetterminal2: Listening for serial connection on port 5002
```
A visualization of the FVP will also be displayed.

Terminate the FVP with `Ctrl+C`.
