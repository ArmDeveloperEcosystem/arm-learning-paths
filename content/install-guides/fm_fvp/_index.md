[Arm Fast Models](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Fast%20Models) are accurate, flexible programmer's view models of Arm IP. They are used to build a virtual platform, either standalone, or as part of Hybrid Simulation environment within EDA partner environments. Use the virtual platform for software development and verification throughout the development process, even long before any real hardware is available.

[Arm Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs)](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Fixed%20Virtual%20Platforms) are a library of such virtual platforms, built with Fast Model technology.

Arm also provides a range of free-of-charge [Ecosystem Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs)](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-ecosystem-fvps) targeting different market segments and applications.
