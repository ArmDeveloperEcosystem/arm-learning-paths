[Arm Compiler for Linux (ACfL)](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Linux) is a suite of tools containing Arm C/C++ Compiler (`armclang`), Arm Fortran Compiler (`armflang`), and Arm Performance Libraries (`ArmPL`). It is tailored to the development of High Performance Computing (HPC) applications.

`Arm Compiler for Linux` runs on 64-bit Arm machines, it is not a cross-compiler.

You do not require any additional license to use `Arm Compiler for Linux`.

## Arm-based hardware

Arm Compiler for Linux supports all 64-bit Arm based [server-class hardware](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/intro/).

Ensure you are using a [supported Linux distribution](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Linux#Supported-Devices).

Confirm you are using an Arm machine by running:

```bash
uname -m
```

The output should be:

```output
aarch64
```

If you see a different result, you are not using an Arm computer running 64-bit Linux.

## Install pre-requisites

If any of the following tools are not already installed by your Linux
distribution, you must install them before installing Arm Compiler for Linux.
These packages can be installed with the appropriate package manager for your OS:

  - SLES: awk environment-modules glibc-devel gzip python3 tar
  - RHEL: environment-modules glibc-devel procps python3
  - Amazon Linux: environment-modules glibc-devel gzip procps python3 tar
  - Ubuntu: environment-modules libc6-dev python3

Note: The minimum supported version for Python is version 3.6.

You must have at least 2 GB of free hard disk space to both download and unpack
the Arm Compiler for Linux package. You must also have an additional 6 GB of
free space to install the package.

For example:

```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python-is-python3 libc6-dev
```

You are now ready to install ACfL [manually](#manual) or with [Spack](#spack).

## Download and install manually {#manual}

### Download with wget

Download releases from the command line using `wget`. Install `wget` if not present.

```console
sudo apt install wget
```

### Fetch the appropriate installer

`ACfL` installation packages are available to download from [Arm Developer](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-compiler-for-linux). Individual `Arm Performance Libraries (ArmPL)` packages are also available.

Fetch the `ACfL` installers:
#### Ubuntu Linux:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
wget  https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/hpc/arm-compiler-for-linux/23-10/arm-compiler-for-linux_23.10_Ubuntu-22.04_aarch64.tar
```
#### Red Hat Linux:
```bash { target="fedora:latest" }
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/hpc/arm-compiler-for-linux/23-10/arm-compiler-for-linux_23.10_RHEL-8_aarch64.tar
```

### Install

To install the `Arm Compiler for Linux` package on your 64-bit Linux Arm machine extract the package and run the installation script.

Each command sequence includes accepting the license agreement to automate the installation and installing the `modules` software.

#### Ubuntu Linux:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest", env="DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive" }
sudo -E apt-get -y install environment-modules python3 libc6-dev
tar -xvf arm-compiler-for-linux_23.10_Ubuntu-22.04_aarch64.tar
cd ./arm-compiler-for-linux_23.10_Ubuntu-22.04
sudo ./arm-compiler-for-linux_23.10_Ubuntu-22.04.sh --accept
```

#### Red Hat Linux:

```bash { target="fedora:latest" }
sudo yum -y install environment-modules python3 glibc-devel
tar -xvf arm-compiler-for-linux_23.10_RHEL-8_aarch64.tar
cd arm-compiler-for-linux_23.10_RHEL-8
sudo ./arm-compiler-for-linux_23.10_RHEL-8.sh --accept
```

### Set up environment

`Arm Compiler for Linux` uses environment modules to dynamically modify your user environment. Refer to the [Environment Modules documentation](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#id) for more information.

Set up the environment, for example, in your `.bashrc` and add module files.

#### Ubuntu Linux:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
echo "source /usr/share/modules/init/bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "module use /opt/arm/modulefiles" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Red Hat Linux:

```bash { target="fedora:latest" }
echo "source /usr/share/Modules/init/bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "module use /opt/arm/modulefiles" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

To list available modules:

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc" }
module avail
```

To configure Arm Compiler for Linux:

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc" }
module load acfl/23.10
```

To configure GCC:

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc" }
module load gnu/12.2.0
```
`ACfL` is now [ready to use](#armclang).

## Download and install with Spack {#spack}

`Arm Compiler for Linux` is available with the [Spack](https://spack.io/) package manager.

See the [Arm Compiler for Linux and Arm PL now available in Spack](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/high-performance-computing-blog/posts/arm-compiler-for-linux-and-arm-pl-now-available-in-spack) blog for full details.

### Setup Spack

Clone the `Spack` repostitory and add `bin` directory to the path:

```console
git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true https://github.com/spack/spack.git
export PATH=/home/ubuntu/spack/bin:$PATH
```

Set up shell support:

```console
. /home/ubuntu/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```

`Spack` is now ready to use.

### Install ACfL

Download and install `Arm Compiler for Linux` with:

```console
spack install acfl
```

If you wish to install just the `Arm Performance Libraries`, use:

```console
spack install armpl-gcc
```

### Setup environment
Use the commands below to set up the environment:

```console
spack load acfl
spack compiler find
```

`ACfL` is now [ready to use](#armclang).


## Get started with Arm C/C++ compiler {#armclang}

To get started with the Arm C/C++ Compiler and compile a simple application follow the steps below.

Check that the correct compiler version is being used:
```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/23.10" }
armclang --version
```

Create a text file named `hello.c` with the contents below.

```C { file_name="hello.c" }
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, C World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Build the application with:

```console { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/23.10" }
armclang hello.c -o hello
```

Run the application with:

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/23.10" }
./hello
```

The program will output the string specified.
```output
Hello, C World!
```

## Get started with Arm Fortran compiler {#fortran}

To get started with the Arm Fortran Compiler and compile a simple application follow the steps below.

Check that the correct compiler version is being used:
```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/23.10" }
armflang --version
```

Create a text file named `hello.f90` with the contents below.

```fortran { file_name="hello.f90" }
program hello
  ! This is a comment line; it is ignored by the compiler
  print *, 'Hello, Fortran World!'
end program hello
```

Build the application with:
```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/23.10" }
armflang hello.f90 -o hello
```

Run the application with:
```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc", pre_cmd="module load acfl/23.10" }
./hello
```

The program will output the string specified.
```output
Hello, Fortran World!
```
