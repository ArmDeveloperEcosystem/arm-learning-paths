[Arm Compiler for Linux (ACfL)](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Linux) is a suite of tools containing Arm C/C++ Compiler (`armclang`), Arm Fortran Compiler (`armflang`), and Arm Performance Libraries (ArmPL). It is tailored to the development of High Performance Computing (HPC) applications.

Arm Compiler for Linux runs on 64-bit Arm machines, it is not a cross-compiler.

You do not require any additional license to use Arm Compiler for Linux.

## What Arm-based hardware is supported by Arm Compiler for Linux (ACfL)?

Arm Compiler for Linux supports all 64-bit Arm based [server-class hardware](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/intro/).

Ensure you are using a [supported Linux distribution](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Linux#Supported-Devices).

Confirm you are using an Arm machine by running:

```bash
uname -m
```

The output should be:

```output
aarch64
```

If you see a different result, you are not using an Arm computer running 64-bit Linux.

## What pre-requisites do I need to install for ACfL?

If any of the following tools are not already installed by your Linux
distribution, you must install them before installing Arm Compiler for Linux.
These packages can be installed with the appropriate package manager for your OS:

  - SLES: awk environment-modules glibc-devel gzip python3 tar
  - RHEL: environment-modules glibc-devel procps python3
  - Amazon Linux: environment-modules glibc-devel gzip procps python3 tar
  - Ubuntu: environment-modules libc6-dev python3

The minimum supported version for Python is version 3.6.

You must have at least 2 GB of free hard disk space to both download and unpack
the Arm Compiler for Linux package. You must also have an additional 6 GB of
free space to install the package.

For example:

```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python-is-python3 libc6-dev
```

You are now ready to install ACfL [manually](#manual) or with [Spack](#spack).

## How do I download and install ACfL using the install script?

Use an Arm recommended script to select, download, and install your preferred ACfL package.

```console
bash <(curl -L https://developer.arm.com/-/cdn-downloads/permalink/Arm-Compiler-for-Linux/Package/install.sh)
```

## How do I download and install ACfL manually? {#manual}

### How do I download ACfL with wget?

Download releases from the command line using `wget`. Install `wget` if not present.

```bash
sudo apt install wget
```

### How do I fetch the appropriate ACfL installer?

ACfL installation packages are available to download from [Arm Developer](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-compiler-for-linux). Individual Arm Performance Libraries (ArmPL) packages are also available.

Fetch the ACfL installers:

#### Ubuntu Linux:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
wget  https://developer.arm.com/-/cdn-downloads/permalink/Arm-Compiler-for-Linux/Version_24.10.1/arm-compiler-for-linux_24.10.1_Ubuntu-22.04_aarch64.tar
```
#### Red Hat Linux:
```bash { target="fedora:latest" }
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/cdn-downloads/permalink/Arm-Compiler-for-Linux/Version_24.10.1/arm-compiler-for-linux_24.10.1_RHEL-9_aarch64.tar
```

### How do I install ACfL?

To install Arm Compiler for Linux on your 64-bit Linux Arm machine extract the package and run the installation script.

Each command sequence includes accepting the license agreement to automate the installation and installing Environment Modules.

#### Ubuntu Linux:

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
sudo -E apt-get -y install environment-modules python3 libc6-dev
tar -xvf arm-compiler-for-linux_24.10.1_Ubuntu-22.04_aarch64.tar
cd ./arm-compiler-for-linux_24.10.1_Ubuntu-22.04
sudo ./arm-compiler-for-linux_24.10.1_Ubuntu-22.04.sh --accept
```

#### Red Hat Linux:

```console
sudo yum -y install environment-modules python3 glibc-devel
tar -xvf arm-compiler-for-linux_24.10.1_RHEL-9_aarch64.tar
cd ./arm-compiler-for-linux_24.10.1_RHEL-9
sudo ./arm-compiler-for-linux_24.10.1_RHEL-9.sh --accept
```

{{% notice Warning %}}
⚠️ On RPM based systems (such as Red Hat), if an
alternative version of GCC (not the GCC bundled with ACfL) is installed
**after** ACfL, you will not be able to uninstall ACfL fully. For example, a GDB
(GNU Project Debugger) installation will install the native system GCC.  If this
install takes place **after** ACfL, you will no longer be able to fully
uninstall ACfL.

## How do I get started with the Arm C/C++ compiler? {#armclang}

To get started with the Arm C/C++ Compiler and compile a simple application follow the steps below.

Check that the correct compiler version is being used:
```bash { env_source="$HOME/.bashrc", pre_cmd=". /usr/share/modules/init/bash; module use /opt/arm/modulefiles; module load acfl/24.10.1" }
armclang --version
```

Create a text file named `hello.c` with the contents below.

```C { file_name="hello.c" }
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, C World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Build the application with:
