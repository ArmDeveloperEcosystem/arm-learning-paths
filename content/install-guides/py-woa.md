Python has native support for Windows on Arm.

Starting with version 3.11, an official installer is available.

## Download and install

[Download the installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0-arm64.exe) to get started.

Once downloaded, run the installer exe file on a Windows on Arm machine. 

The installer will start. 

Check "Add python.exe to PATH" if you want to easily invoke python from any directory.

Wait for the installer to complete and show the message, "Setup was successful".

## Invoke python

At a Windows Command prompt or a PowerShell prompt use `python` or `py` to start the interpreter.
```cmd
C:\>py
Python 3.11.0 (main, Oct 24 2022, 18:15:22) [MSC v.1933 64 bit (ARM64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

## Test an example

To confirm python is working, save the code below into a file `uname.py`.

```python
import platform
print("Python version", platform.python_version())
print("Machine is", platform.uname().system, platform.uname().release, platform.uname().machine)
```
Run the code.
```console
py uname.py
```
Running on a Windows on Arm machine produces the output:
```output
Python version 3.11.0
Machine is Windows 10 ARM64
```
## Installing packages

Python `pip` can be used to install packages. 

For example, to install `Flask`:
```console
pip install Flask
```
Save the code below as `hello.py`:

```python
import platform
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "<h1><b>Hello from %s %s %s %s</b></h1>" % (platform.system(), platform.release(), platform.version(), platform.machine())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
```

Run the application:
```console
python hello.py
```

The output will be similar to:
```output
C:\>python hello.py
 * Serving Flask app 'hello'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://192.168.68.95:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
```
Open a browser to the URL printed by the application.

The output is in the browser.
