[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is an open source programming language. 

This install guide is for Linux application developers wishing to use Rust. 

If you wish to use Rust to build embedded applications for Arm, refer to [Rust for Embedded Applications](../rust_embedded) instead.

## Before you begin

Rust is available for a variety of operating systems and Linux distributions, and there are multiple ways to install it.

This install guide provides a quick solution to install Rust on an Arm Linux distribution.

Confirm you are using an Arm machine by running:

```bash
uname -m
```

The output should be:

```output
aarch64
```

If you see a different result, you are not using an Arm computer running 64-bit Linux.

## Installation {#install}

### Installing dependencies on Debian based distributions such as Ubuntu

Use the `apt` command to install the required software packages on any Debian-based Linux distribution, including Ubuntu.

```bash { target="ubuntu:latest" }
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y curl gcc
```

### Installing dependencies on Red Hat / Fedora / Amazon Linux

These Linux distributions use `yum` as the package manager.

Use the `yum` command to install the required software packages. If the machine has `sudo` you can use it.

```bash { target="fedora:latest" }
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y curl gcc
```

### Download and install Rust

Run the following command to download and install Rust:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
```

The installer output will be similar to:

```output

Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started, you may need to restart your current shell.
This reloads your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, run:
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

The latest version of Rust is now installed. 

The installer updates `$HOME/.bashrc` and `SHOME/.profile` to set up the environment. Start a new shell or run the following command to continue:

```bash
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

To confirm the installation is complete run `cargo version` (`cargo` is the Rust package manager):

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc" }
cargo version
```

This command will print the version:

```output
cargo 1.74.1 (ecb9851af 2023-10-18)
```

You are ready to use the Rust programming language on your Arm Linux machine.

## Get started {#start}

To compile an example program, run the following commands:

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc" }
cargo new hello
cd hello
cargo run
```

The `cargo run` command outputs:

```output
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (/hello)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.44s
     Running `target/debug/hello`
Hello, world!
```
