[Arm Development Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio) is the most comprehensive embedded C/C++ dedicated software development solution. It is used for validation of SoC debug through emulation, simulation, FPGA, and silicon bring-up design and verification stages. It has the earliest support for all Arm processors and interconnects.

## Before you begin

Arm Development Studio can be installed on Windows and Linux hosts.

Full host platform requirements are given in the [Getting Started Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/latest/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Hardware-and-host-platform-requirements).

## Download installer packages

The installer will depend on the [edition](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio#Editions) of Development Studio that you are entitled to. 

Gold, Silver, and Bronze editions are one installer, with available features defined by the license. The version is denoted by `year.index`, where `index` is a number (for example `2023.0`). You can also generate an Evaluation license from this installation (`Help` > `Arm License Manager`), with capabilities broadly similar to the Gold Edition.

You can download the Development Studio installer from the [Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/view/DS000B).

Development Studio Platinum Edition has its own installation package. The version is denoted by `year.index`, where `index` is a letter (for example `2023.a`). Platinum Edition is only available to certain Arm licensees.

For more information about the Product Download Hub, refer to the [Product Download Hub installation guide](../pdh).

## Install Arm Development Studio

### Windows

Unzip the downloaded installation archive.

It is easiest to simply double-click the installation wizard (`armds-<version>.exe`), and follow on-screen instructions.

To install silently from the command line, use similar to the following:
```command
msiexec /i DS000-BN-00000-r23p0-00rel0\data\armds-2023.0.msi EULA=1 SKIP_DRIVERS=1 /qn
```
{{% notice  Drivers%}}
This command does not install the debug probe USB drivers. If these are needed, remove `SKIP_DRIVERS=1` from the above. This requires manual interaction. They can also be installed manually later (`<install_dir>\sw\driver_files\driver_install.bat`) if necessary.

Full installation instructions are provided in the Windows section of the [Arm Development Studio Getting Started Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/latest/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Installing-on-Windows).

### Linux

Extract the downloaded package:
```command
tar -xf DS000-BN-00001-r23p0-00rel0.tgz
cd DS000-BN-00001-r23p0-00rel0
```
To install silently from the command line, use similar to the following.
```command
sudo ./armds-2023.0.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula --no-interactive -f -q
```
{{% notice Libraries%}}
The install may report that additional [libraries](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/latest/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Additional-Linux-libraries) are needed to be installed.

Full installation instructions are provided in the Linux section of the [Arm Development Studio Getting Started Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/latest/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Installing-on-Linux).

## Configure command line

### Windows

You will see `Arm DS <version> Command Prompt` installed. This configures all necessary environment variables for use with the tools. You can select an appropriate toolchain with:
```command
select_toolchain
```
or set a default version with:
```command
select_default_toolchain
```
{{% notice  Toolchains%}}
By default, only the supplied `Arm Compiler for Embedded 6` is installed with Arm Development Studio. Other versions can be installed and [registered](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/2023-0/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Register-a-compiler-toolchain).
{{% /notice %}}

### Linux

Navigate to `bin` directory of your install, for example:
```command
cd /opt/arm/developmentstudio-2023.0/bin
```
Use `suite_exec` to start an appropriate command prompt, for example:
```command
suite_exec --toolchain "Arm Compiler for Embedded 6" bash
```
To remove the need for the `--toolchain` option, first run:
```command
select_default_toolchain
```
and select the desired toolchain. You can then configure with simply:
```command
suite_exec bash
```

## Arm Development Studio IDE

Arm Development Studio is provided with a fully featured Eclipse based IDE and integrated debugger.

Launch the IDE from your desktop, or from the above prompt using:
```command
./armds_ide
```

## Set up the product license

Arm Development Studio is license managed. When you launch the IDE for the first time, you should be prompted to set up your license and select the Edition. You can return to this view from `Help` > `Arm License Manager`.

A free 30 day evaluation license for Arm Development Studio is also available. You can generate this in `Arm License Manager`. Click on `Add`, and follow instructions therein to obtain the evaluation license (requires Arm login).

Alternative license setup instructions are available in the [Arm Licensing install guide](../license/).

## Get started

To verify everything is working OK, run the compiler from your command prompt:
```command
armclang --version
```
You should now be ready to use Arm Development Studio. See the [Get started with Arm Development Studio](/learning-paths/embedded-systems/armds/) learning path for more information.
