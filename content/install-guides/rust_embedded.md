[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is an open source programming language. 

This install guide is for embedded developers wishing to use Rust for their applications. 

If you wish to use Rust to build Linux applications on an Arm Linux platform, refer to [Rust for Linux Applications](../rust) instead.

This install guide assumes an Ubuntu Linux host.

For further information, see [The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/).

## Installation {#install}

### Download and install Rust

Run the following command to download and install Rust:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Start a new shell or run the following command to continue:

```bash
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```
To confirm the installation is complete, run the following (`cargo` is the Rust package manager):

```bash { env_source="~/.bashrc" }
rustc --version
cargo version
```

The output will be similar to:
```output
rustc 1.78.0 (9b00956e5 2024-04-29)
cargo 1.78.0 (54d8815d0 2024-03-26)
```
### Add Arm cross-compilation support

Add cross compilation support for the Arm Architectures needed. For example, to add support for Armv7-M architecture use:
```command
rustup target add thumbv7m-none-eabi
```
For a full list of supported architectures, use:
```command
rustup target list
```

### Install cargo-generate

To generate a project from a template you will need `cargo-generate`. To install and rebuild use:

```command
sudo apt install -y libssl-dev pkg-config
sudo apt install -y build-essential
cargo install cargo-generate
```

### Install cargo-binutils (optional)

Other utilities are also available. For completeness they can be installed with:
```command
cargo install cargo-binutils
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
```

You are now ready to build an embedded application in Rust.
